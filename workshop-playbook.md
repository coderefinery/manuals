### Certificate coordinator
<https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/certificates/>

- lead: 
- backup: ASC team (the process can be run by anyone and we are now using a ticketing system to track requests)

:::spoiler Checklist
- [ ] Make sure that instructions on certificates are disseminated multiple times
  - [ ] Workshop page, emails
	```
	- Learner sends materials to scip _at_ aalto.fi. This opens a ticket in Aalto "esupport" system
	- The person who generates the certificate verifies quickly that the tasks were completed.
	- We then work with https://github.com/coderefinery/generate-certificates to generate PDF certificates
	- Certificate is sent to the person and ticket is closed
	- Aalto specific:
	    - The local version of that repository is at /scratch/rse/generate-certificates/. The commands were slightly modified so that the default working directory is not the home folder
	    - Aalto students can also obtain directly the 1 ECTS credit. See internal process at ASC pages.
