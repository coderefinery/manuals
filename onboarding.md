# New team member onboarding 

## Good to know

CodeRefinery is a training network around FAIR research software development. We usually offer two massive streamed interactive online workshops per year with instructors from within the team but also try to onboard new instructors from anywhere. You can find all information about how we do workshops in our [manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals). Many partners are also collaborate on additional workshops or hackathons. But CodeRefinery is not only workshops: It also is a community of people who enjoy helping others. We also want to do more outreach, so if you are a social media guru or enjoy giving presentations in different forums, we would be delighted if you could help with that. Below you can find all links that are useful for anyone joining the CodeRefinery team.

Anyone can be part of the team! If your organization officially wants to join:
- If your organization is in the Nordics, it can become a partner in the project. 
- If your organization is outside the Nordics, it can become an observer in the project.

## CodeRefinery activities you may want to join

###  Instructor

Our main tools workshop is happening twice a year in spring/autumn. For these workshops, we always have two instructors per topic and provide an instructor onboarding before the workshop when needed. We have gathered a lot of information and guides about "how to instructor at a CodeRefinery workshop", but the main aspects are summarized in our {doc}`instructor-intro`.

As an instructor you should bring or be willing to acquire the following tools and skills: 

- Competence in FAIR software practises
- Interest in online streamed teaching to large audience
- Pedagogical skills
- Patience with supporting students and researchers without technical background about software tools and techniques
- Persons who like working with others since the teaching always happens in collaboration with others
- A decent camera and microphone for clear audio and video

Apart from instructors, our workshops also have a lot of other roles to fill: {ref}`roles`. 

### Material contributor

Apart from lesson materials feedback and improvements, we also welcome any feedback and improvement suggestions on our manuals (these files here), installation instructions, webpage etc. Open tasks are summarized on the [CodeRefinery webpage](https://coderefinery.org/tasks/).

More info at {ref}`contribute`. 

Help us make the lesson and other materials more clear, expand on examples, add exercises or new sections!

To help with material development, you will need or be ready to acquire the following tools and skills: 

- GitHub account
- Skills in open source collaborative lesson development; fits well as learning by doing!

Apart from contributing new materials, contributions by others also need to be reviewed. 
In order not to put pressure on the individuals we try to use the coderefinery-team as reviewers. 
If you notice a pending review, please at least read and comment, even if you do not feel confident in merging.  

### Organize other collaborative workshops

As mentioned above, CodeRefinery is a training collective. Apart from the main CodeRefinery workshop, partners may also choose to collaborate on other related training topics. The best way to get in touch is via Zulip chat. 

### Support with outreach

It is incredibly hard to reach our target audience at the right time in their career. Please help! 
We have social media channels that could always use some entertaining posts, a blog to share experiences, submit a talk or poster for a domain specific conference, or other places where our target audience may already be. 

## Thank you!

No matter what you choose to do, we are happy to have you!
CodeRefinery lives through its people and community!
