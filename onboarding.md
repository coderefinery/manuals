# Onboarding 

## Good to know

CodeRefinery is a training network around FAIR research software development. We usually offer two massive streamed interactive online workshops per year with instructors from within the team but also try to onboard new instructors from anywhere. You can find all information about how we do workshops in our [manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals). Many partners are also collaborate on additional workshops or hackathons. But CodeRefinery is not only workshops: It also is a community of people who enjoy helping others. We also want to do more outreach, so if you are a social media guru or enjoy giving presentations in different forums, we would be delighted if you could help with that. Below you can find all links that are useful for anyone joining CodeRefinery in any capacity.

## Become an instructor

We are always looking for new instructors for our main tools workshop happening twice a year in spring/autumn. For these workshops, we always have two instructors per topic and provide an instructor onboarding before the workshop when needed. We have gathered a lot of information and guides about "how to instructor at a CodeRefinery workshop", but the main aspects are summarized in our {doc}`instructor-intro`.

As an instructor you should bring or be willing to acquire the following tools and skills: 

- Competence in FAIR software practises
- Interest in online streamed teaching to large audience
- Pedagogical skills
- Patience with supporting students and researchers without technical background about software tools and techniques
- Persons who like working with others since the teaching always happens in collaboration with others
- A decent camera and microphone for clear audio and video


## Help us improve our materials

Apart from lesson materials feedback and improvements, we also welcome any feedback and improvement suggestions on our manuals (these files here), installation instructions, webpage etc. Open tasks are summarized on the [CodeRefinery webpage](https://coderefinery.org/tasks/).

To help with material development, you will need or be ready to acquire the following tools and skills: 

- GitHub account
- Skills in open source collaborative lesson development; fits well as learning by doing!
