Outreach plan
=============

This is a prototype the CodeRefinery outreach and marketing plan.

Since most of us are not very good at marketing, this is actually a
summary of the book *The new rules of marketing and PR : how to use
content marketing, podcasting, social media, AI, live video, and
newsjacking to reach buyers directly* (David Meerman Scott, 8th ed.)
with descriptions of how it can apply to CodeRefinery.  The book is
available at my university's O'Reilly Online Learning platform through
our library for free.  If you like what you read here, consider
checking it out - the book was a very good inspiration for someone
that needs to outreach better, but is not at all that kind of person
and needs some inspiration for how to even think about it.

Perhaps this summary is useful to others outside of CodeRefinery as
well.

Currently, this page is one person's description and their own
interpretation9 as it applies to CodeRefinery.  Over time, it should
be adapted to represent a broader view, this paragraph updated,
possibly the current content archived, and the new plan made into a
new page.


Introduction
------------

Many people need marketing and outreach: CodeRefinery isn't trying to
sell things, but we are trying to encourage people to make a choice to
gain skills.  It's free, but it does have a cost: time.  We think that
it does save more time in the long run, but then again, how many
businesses sell things that will save money in the long run?

We need to encourage people to make a specific choice, and we need to
tell them why we think that is the best choice for them.


1 The Old Rules of Marketing and PR Are Ineffective in an Online World
----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Interruption advertising" doesn't work (anymore?).  Few people want
to have their life interrupted with a TV commercial, banner ad, or
email from university administrators telling them to make some
choice.  People think of different things now.

For CodeRefinery, you could argue that flyers, emails from university
staff, etc. are all some form of interruption advertising.

There's all kind of anecdotes about how advertisement, mentions in the
press, and so on aren't useful, but we wouldn't do those anyway.
Although, we do want press, that's not the main way we get people to
take our courses.  (maybe it helps our funding, though)


2 The New Rules of Marketing and PR
-----------------------------------

People do, however, take recommendations from people they know.  Social
media lets people communicate.  The match is clear.  By making good
use of social media, we can reach people directly.

(this chapter starts off with an example of social media inspiring the
author to visit Saariselkä in Finnish Lapland, which was interesting
to see.)


3 Reaching Your Buyers Directly
-------------------------------

Social media lets people reach buyers directly.  This is obvious.

But, how to use social media.  You don't want to go doing interruption
advertising, trying to use it to directly sell your stuff.  Instead,
produce good, free content which people will want to consume.  Most of
your activity should be about this, which gets people interested, and
makes them want more.  Then, when they want to go deeper or are ready
to make a purchase, they come to you.

CodeRefinery does nothing but make free content, so how does this
apply to us?  Well, we have to think more.  Our main content costs a
lot of time, so we need to think of content that is shorter and easier
to consume.  For example:

* Short videos or pictures explaining things.
* Short blog posts about tips or tricks, which have a clear, catchy,
  immediately useful title.
* Tweeting links to specific pages we have just made, which are
  especially useful standalone.
* Short "git hacks" or clever things, which people like and share, and
  makes them want to attend a workshop.
* "Research software minute" videos?

You have to think of buyer personas - backwards design all of your
material.  Don't make anything unless you know who it is for, and then
make sure it is suitable for that person.  Know their goal, how they
speak, and where they are (what content do they consume?).

CodeRefinery buyer personas could include:

* Learners
* Exercise leaders
* Group leaders or university staff who can recommend their audience
  to attend a workshop
* Prospective instructors and helpers
* Funders and high-level leadership


4 Social Media and Your Targeted Audience
-----------------------------------------

Descriptions of what social media is.  A somewhat useful metaphor is
that the web is like a city.  Social media are things like bars or
cafes.  You don't go there and start asking people to do something or
offering free samples and expect people to like it.  You network,
talk, maybe tell some interesting stories.  Maybe someone figures out
who you are and would want to know more about what you do.


5 The Content‐Rich Website
--------------------------

Websites matter - people will go there and check it out.  Blogs are
good, they last longer than any single social media operator and
provide long-term web traffic.  Websites (and everything) need
specific skills and a manager.  The website needs a personality and
voice.

CodeRefinery should make sure that there is are clear target pages or
sections for each of our target personas below.  We should make sure
we don't use jargon that we would use, or have the website organized
by our own operations as opposed to learner personas.  We should also
make sure the website is accessible and mobile-friendly.


6 Marketing and PR in Real Time
-------------------------------

Following social media in real time can let you know what people
think.  This can be an even better feedback method than surveys, etc.
By responding in real time (this can take effort), you can have
conversations there (in the open) which is also very good for
outreach.

CodeRefinery could consider monitoring more of social media.  TODO:
how to do this?


7 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Marketing and PR
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We know about AI and so on.  We also know it's not magic.  There were
discussions about using AI to generate some content, such as tweets
from web pages.

I didn't see much useful for CodeRefinery here, however some ideas
(run our webpages through a text summarizer to get the most important
sentences to help us make tweets) might be useful.


8 You Are What You Publish: Building Your Marketing and PR Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is the chapter that puts everything above together, before it
goes off into details of the implementation next.

1. Understand what we want. (CR: we could say "better science" but it
   can also mean things like "attend workshops" or "ensure funding for
   the project")
2. List the buyer personas relevant to us. (See chapter 3 for the list)
3. Create a persona around each of these buyers. (CR: see chapter 3
   above for the details).

   * What are their goals?
   * What do we want them to do?
   * What content do they consume?
   * How do they make their buying choices? (CR: how do you decide how
     to spend your time?)
   * How do they speak, talk, and read?
   * Subscribe to and follow the media they follow.

4. Develop (free) content that interests each of these buyers.
5. Develop a measuring plan.  Think about how we can measure success,
   both in immediate engagement and making the decision we want (what
   we actually want).


9 Growing Your Business: How Marketing and PR Drive Sales
---------------------------------------------------------

Salespeople don't mediate between buyers and companies anymore.
Instead, people can find so much information themselves, and make
purchases self-service.  Websites and other material have to be target
to buyers (= potential learners) who are deciding if they want to
purchase (= attend a course).  Websites and material should have a
personality (= our website shouldn't be written as boring as a
scientific paper).  It's OK to do fun things.  Social aspects to the
site is good - e.g. comments section, social media share buttons.

1. Begin with informational content (not necessarily about you).
2. Nudge towards what you want (= attend a course, etc.)
3. Make it easy to close the deal. (CR: clear "notify me" mailing list
   link on every relevant page.  Maybe even make sure we have
   continually open registration for the next workshop - each workshop
   is ready for registration when the previous one ends.  When we have
   multiple types of workshops, includeable html snippets that has links
   to register for every upcoming workshop?)

Don't underestimate the value of figurehead leaders (~=CEOs) being
social - don't just delegate it to separate marketers.

Is the analogy of salespeople even relevant for CodeRefinery?
Probably not, but maybe we could say that official requirement,
recommended courses, university staff aren't so important.  People
will check our websites and other material to see if they want to
attend.

Every website, lesson, and so on has to have very clear information
targeted to a possible reader right at the beginning, so that a
potential learner might see "is this git lesson right for me?" and
they will find "yes".

Our website should be current.


10 Strategies for Creating Awesome Content
------------------------------------------

This section has different strategies and types of content.  Types of
content include: blogs, audio, video, photos, infographics, charts,
email newsletters, presentations, long-form written content, research
reports, virtual events, e-books, white papers, apps.

Think about how you make the content: don't just write about
yourself.  Consider the problems your buyers face and make content
that solves those problems.  Write for your personas.  Advertise what
you do.  Think what could possibly go viral.  Don't forget that it
should be accessible.


11 How to Write for Your Buyers
-------------------------------

Write like your buyers talk (we've said this before), and don't use
pointless jargon or meaningless words to make you sound smarter.
Humor is OK.  Think like a journalist (especially for some content
types).


12 Social Networking as Marketing
---------------------------------

Facebook pages, Facebook groups.  Linkedin profiles, companies, etc.
There are many more, but think about what is right for you, don't do
something just because it is there.  Consider your personal brand -
make sure your profile information says something.  There is a
recommendation 85% sharing and engaging, 10% original content, 5%
promoting yourself.  Social media is like exercise: you need to make
it part of your routine, or you will stop doing it.

For CodeRefinery, we know we should be more active on Twitter, which
seems like the most suitable network for us.  Are there any types of
badges we can use for professional social networks?

Most people in CodeRefinery seem to be hesitant to use social network
sites heavily, for good reason.  We should really encourage and
support those who do want to use them to do so on our behalf, as much
as possible.


13 Blogging to Reach Your Buyers
--------------------------------

Blogs are very important - and unlike social networks, they stay under
your control long-term, and drive search traffic straight to you.
Consider who you want to reach - potential learners?  existing
learners?  other thought leaders?  Blog about things that they are
interested in and you are passionate about.

Don't forget to monitor other blogs from people who do similar things,
to keep up to date with what is going on.  Comment on other blogs and
link back to you.  Invite other bloggers to visit you and blog about
their experiences - this is good for both of you.

CodeRefinery probably knows that it should blog more.  Some ideas
about what to blog about are in previous sections.  We should make it
easier to share posts, and would we even want to try for a commenting
feature (might be too much, though...).

20 Newsjacking Your Way into the Media
--------------------------------------

*(I haven't fully read this chapter yet)*

The idea here is that when something interesting to your audience and
relevant to you comes up in the news, react to it / contribute
something to it, perhaps preferably in a way that can be re-shared.
Or in a way that other journalists.  Be careful, don't do this
dis-respectfully or spammily.

In CodeRefinery, different things in the science news could be
relevant to react to.
