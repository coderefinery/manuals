# Lesson contribution guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to **CodeRefinery**! All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. We welcome contributions from everyone (technical experts, legal experts, and newcomers alike).

We use GitHub issues to communicate things that need to be updated, collect feedback and improvement suggestions. 
Latest prior to every workshop we go through the issues and implement and resolve at least the urgent ones. 

All our lesson materials are written in Markdown using our own [Sphinx lesson template](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template).

## How you can contribute

There are three ways to contribute, ordered from the easiest to the most demanding one:

### 1. Small fixes and suggestions submitted via "Issues"

If you find a typo or have a quick suggestion, but cannot edit it yourself using git, you can open an issue describing the problem or proposal. Maintainers will review your suggestion and address it. 

### 2. Small fixes and suggestions with git

If you are familiar with git version control and you spot a typo, broken link, or error, you can submit a quick fix with git. Even small improvements like clarifying text or adding references are valuable. Usually the process works like this:

* If you do not have one, get a GitHub account. 
* Fork Repository: This creates your own copy where you can freely edit.
* Use the **GitHub's web editor** or your local favourite editor (after git clone) to work on a new version! 
* Make your changes: edit or add the content. Please write in Markdown. If adding code or commands, format them properly (use code blocks) and test if applicable.
* Submit a ***Pull Request***: Once your changes are ready, open a Pull Request (PR) to the main lesson repository. In the PR description, briefly explain your changes and why they improve the lesson. If your contribution closes an existing issue, mention it. CodeRefinery project members will review your PR, provide feedback if needed, and merge it when it’s ready. 

Tip: If you’re new to this, check out [our lesson on collaborative version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/).

### 3. Large edits

You can also add substantial contribution to the lessons, like a new section, improve an explanation, or include an example related to a specific topic. For major new content creation, please open an issue first to discuss your idea with the community, so we can coordinate and avoid overlaps.

## Style and content guidelines

To keep the lessons consistent and accessible, please keep these guidelines in mind when writing:

- Clarity and Tone: Aim for a clear, concise writing style. Explain acronyms or technical terms in simple language so that readers from various backgrounds can follow. Our tone is professional, but not overly formal or technical: think of explaining concepts to a colleague who is not an expert in the topic of any CodeRefinery lesson.
- Formatting: Write content in Markdown. Use headings and bullet points to organize information logically (as seen in our existing chapters). Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences) for readability. When adding code snippets, use code blocks and include comments if needed for explanation. 
- Content Accuracy: Ensure any facts or claims are accurate, ideally with a peer reviewed citation. 
- Originality and Licensing: Contribute only your own work and do not plagiarize from other texts. By submitting a contribution, you agree that you wrote the content (or have rights to it) and that it can be included under the project’s open license.
- Privacy Considerations: Your name (or nickname) will be publicly visible and associated to the contribution. Due to the distributed nature of open source projects, you accept that it will be impossible to delete your contribution from the version control history.
- Use of generative AI: the use of generative AI is accepted only for basic checks of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. If you use generative AI you must declare it in your contribution and describe how it was used. 
- Images: only original images can be submitted. Image files for new images should be submitted as editable format using SVG as open standard for vector graphics. Photographs can only be used if released with a compatible creative common license. 
- For any contribtion larger than fixing a typo: Do not forget to add yourself as a contributor in the lesson repositories citation.cff file.

## Creating a new CodeRefinery lesson

We have a self-explaining [Sphinx-lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/sphinx-lesson/). 

## Code of conduct

Our virtual lesson environment adheres to the [CodeRefinery "Code of Conduct"](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/) to ensure a welcoming environment for all. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. In short, please be respectful and constructive in your interactions. For example, we expect everyone to be open to different viewpoints, to give and receive feedback kindly, and to avoid derogatory language – in other words, be empathetic and courteous to others. Admins will take actions in case of violations of the code of conduct.
