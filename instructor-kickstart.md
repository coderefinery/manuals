# Instructor kickstart program

This page describes the instructor kickstart program.


## Other background information

The [CodeRefinery instructor
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/) is a
longer version of this that is more about the philosophy and has less
concrete practice.  This page has the basic sessions that new
instructors should do to prepare.


## Session 1: General motivation (1hr + 2-3 day follow-up)

This happens well before the course, as early as practical.

Preparation: Generally have an idea about the CodeRefinery teaching
style (have watched a course before, or maybe seen [this 15-minute
video with examples](https://youtu.be/WjmttAniZX8?t=3).

We will:
* A motivational meeting about what it's like to be an instructor.
  Here the inside story from someone who's done it.
* Go over the various material that you should read yourself (hear at
  least one person's own opinion on it)

Follow-up:
* Read everything in the instructor section of the manuals (left
  sidebar of this site).
* Read the [lesson review checklist](lesson-review) material (left
  sidebar).
* Begin working with your co-instructor on preparing the lesson,
  deciding how you want to teach, etc. {doc}`team-teaching`,
  {doc}`teaching-plan`.  (If this is your first time, hopefully your
  co-instructor takes the lead on any possible lesson changes.  Try to
  avoid changes though!)
* Ask your co-instructor for their advice on becoming a new instructor
  and to mentor you.


## Meeting 2: Team teaching practice (2hr + 2-3 day follow-up)

This happens a few weeks before the course.

We will:
* Go through the [team teaching
  practice](https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/streaming-practice-1/).
* The purpose is to practice coordination with your co-instructor
  and the director.  Go through the basic mechanics.
* Most practice is with very simple toy problems (e.g. "make a git
  repo"), so extensive lesson prep isn't needed.
* It may or may not include some livestream practice.
* Talk about how the prep is going in general.


Follow-up:
* Finish all the lesson preparation.
* Practice team teaching with your co-instructor (ideally a full
  run-through)
* Get all the instructor tech setup done (everything from the sidebar,
  see {doc}`instructor-checklist`).
* Ask the instructor trainer (or anyone else) advice on the lessons.


## Meeting 3: Livestream practice and final instructor test (1-2hr)

This happens a few days before the teaching.

Preparation: Make sure all the instructor technical setup is done
(computer setup, audio, screenshare), so you can get final feedback on
your exact setup.  All the [final checklist](instructor-checklist) stuff.

We will:
* Do a whole test with your computer + practice livestream
* You will practice the first 5 minutes of your lesson, going to a
  break, last 5 minutes, maybe a Q&A.  Whatever we have time for.
* There's some duplication of the previous session, now it's time to
  refine it.

Follow-up:
* Improve any problems that you found.
* Final prep with co-instructor.


## Teach!

Relax, it's not so hard.  You have a huge support network for anything
that may go wrong, and will get continual feedback even during the
course.
