# Instructor checklists

## Check with someone before you start teaching

**Most importantly, get your setup done well in advance and show your
co-teachers for feedback.  Feedback and time to improve is very
important to make things beautiful.**



## Lesson revision checklist

See the lesson development section.


## Final checklist

- Have you moved your configurations away and done the course setup
  instead (or left it unconfigured)?: `.bashrc` (or equivalent),
  `.gitconfig`, `.ssh`, `.conda`, etc.
- Are you using a software environment as described in the workshop
  instructions (conda, virtualenv, etc).  Is it clean and without
  extra stuff installed?
- Is your setup as boring-looking as possible, if you are teaching at
  the beginning of the workshop?  The first sessions aren't the time
  for distractions.
- Is your terminal
  - Dark text on light background? (if not: create a profile so you
    can switch now or in the future)
  - Do you know key-bindings to change the font size quickly?
- Do you have command history set up?  If in doubt, use
  [prompt-log](https://github.com/rkdarst/prompt-log/) and `tail` the
  output in a separate smaller window.
- Do you have a clean web browser session (different profile for
  demos)?
- If you use an advanced shell, do you have a simpler shell (bash) set
  up for the demos?
- (if online) have you practiced Zoom screensharing "Share a portion
  of the screen" in portrait-mode?  See
  {doc}`instructor-screenshare`.
- (if online) have you checked your audio settings?  Join a test
  meeting with someone and understand your microphone sound
  adjustments.  Can you control it for the full range from very quiet
  to very loud, so that you can make whatever adjustments needed?  Is
  your best microphone/headset ready? *Audio quality and balance is
  critical.*
- Have you shown your setup to someone else for feedback?
