# (Co-)Instructors

Instructors are the ones who "lecture" in the workshops - but of
course there are many other roles which are helping with the teaching,
most notably team leaders and other helpers.

This page links guides on various aspects of being an instructor.

Join the `#coderefinery-tools-workshop` and `#events` channel in the [coderefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) and see what workshops are planned.
Below a few things that might be of interest if you want to teach with us:


## Responsibilities of an instructor

- Review, triage, and work on lesson issues
- Define exercises
- Communicate exercise list to Exercise coordinator
- Set up and test a quality screen share
- Coordinate with co-instructor
- Communicate software requirements to Instructor coordinator
- Communicate timing adjustments to Instructor coordinator
- After planning/editing the lesson: Do a dry run (prefereably with someone "new" to the topic)



## Why co-teaching?

Demo of team teaching.  Two people are speaking, in this case one
is typing and giving the small point of view, and one is explaining
the big point of view.
```

The dream of interactive teaching is hard to achieve: most audiences
are very quiet and even if someone does speak up, it is a small
fraction of the audience.  We have found a better way: Build the
interaction straight in to the course by co-teaching.  Instead of
trying to have a conversation with students, we have a conversation
among co-instructors.

Co-teaching provides other benefits, such as easier preparation and
easier presentation.



## From team leader/helper to more

Here is one possible pathway from learner to (whatever else).  This is
an *idea* for a pathway but by no means a requirement - you can join
at whatever step you like, and steps don't have to happen in order.
Maybe you are interested in some or the other.  There are also roles
completely outside of this pathway.

* After being a learner, you come back as an team leader/helper.
* When you have a solid understanding of all materials, you may join
  as an expert helper.
* You begin co-teaching episodes with someone else
  * We find that co-teaching is a good way to start.  In this, there
    are two people, one person assumes the big-picture discussion, and
    the other the typing and explaining what they are doing.  By
    making the lesson a discussion instead of a lecture, it's more
    dynamic.
* Eventually, you get confident enough to teach yourself (though
  really we should always be co-teaching...)
* Somewhere in there (before or after instructor, depending on your
  interests), you may want to try to be a HackMD helper or Zoom host.
  These are more about coordinating all the other people involved in
  the workshop.

Let's emphasize again: this is one pathway, but you should do what you
want.



## Preparing for your first time

An example of a beautiful screenshare.  Note the portrait orientation
(you have half the screen free for notes and HackMD, learners have
half the screen free to do their own work).  The terminal is
dark-on-light, a minimal prompt, no other fancy shell distractions,
there is a shell history visible, and slightly distinct colors between
the web browser and the terminal.
```

- There is some generic technical setup for your own computer - make a
  clean environment that matches learners, make a good prompt, and so
  on.  See {doc}`instructor-tech-setup` and
  {doc}`instructor-tech-online`.
- Watch the [Demo of CodeRefinery livestream teaching
  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjmttAniZX8) (read the
  description for an explanation).
- Talk and plan with your co-instructors: decide which model of
  co-teaching you will give.
- Plan the material, try to go through all of the exercises and
  type-along.
- Do a run-through of the lesson, practicing what each person says.
  This can be relatively quick (remember, most of the time in an
  actual lesson is learners doing exercises alone).

  - Also check the technical setup - make sure that it looks good on
    screen.
