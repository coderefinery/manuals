# Instructors

Instructors are the ones who "lecture" in the workshops - but of
course there are many other roles which are helping with the teaching,
most notably team leaders and other helpers.

This page links guides on various aspects of being an instructor.

Join the `#coderefinery-tools-workshop` and `#events` channel in the [coderefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) and see what workshops are planned.

## Responsibilities of an instructor

- Review, triage, and work on lesson issues
- Define exercises
- Communicate exercise list to Exercise coordinator
- Set up and test a quality screen share
- Coordinate with co-instructor
- Communicate software requirements to Instructor coordinator
- Communicate timing adjustments to Instructor coordinator
- After planning/editing the lesson: Do a dry run (prefereably with someone "new" to the topic)


## From team leader/helper to more

Here is one possible pathway from learner to (whatever else).  This is
an *idea* for a pathway but by no means a requirement - you can join
at whatever step you like, and steps don't have to happen in order.
Maybe you are interested in some or the other.  There are also roles
completely outside of this pathway.

* After being a learner, you come back as an team leader/helper.
* When you have a solid understanding of all materials, you may join
  as an expert helper.
* You begin co-teaching episodes with someone else
  * We find that co-teaching is a good way to start.  In this, there
    are two people, one person assumes the big-picture discussion, and
    the other the typing and explaining what they are doing.  By
    making the lesson a discussion instead of a lecture, it's more
    dynamic.
* Eventually, you get confident enough to teach yourself (though
  really we should always be co-teaching...)
* Somewhere in there (before or after instructor, depending on your
  interests), you may want to try to be a HackMD helper or Zoom host.
  These are more about coordinating all the other people involved in
  the workshop.

Let's emphasize again: this is one pathway, but you should do what you
want.
