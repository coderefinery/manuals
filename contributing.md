# Contributing to CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any random contributions: feel free to make any kind of 

If you aren't sure you are ready for more, you can always lurk
(passively watch our community) and join when you feel the time is right.

These manuals (and in general, other guides we have) describe the
past, not (only) the future.  They are made so that new people can
know what we have done in the past, so they can work on the future.

A good way to get started is to take the lead of some workshop (doing
it like it was before), then do it again with your own improvements.

## How to watch and communicate

- Join CodeRefinery chat, give comments or submit emoji reactions to
  show how you feel about things.  Most things are announced only
  through zulipchat.
- Watch GitHub repositories to get notified of issues and pull
  requests.  Anyone can watch any repository.

## Types of contributions

Some examples of what you can do...

Quick things:

- Fix issues in our lessons, or at least point out problems you see!
- Contribute to lessons.
- Help us advertise CodeRefinery to others who can benefit.

A bit more commitment:

- Invite us to give a workshop, serve as a local host and help ensure
  there are lots of attendees
- Be a helper with in our workshops.

Get really involved:
- Hang out on our [CodeRefinery chat](chat)
- Teach a lesson using our materials yourself
- Be come a CodeRefinery instructor
- Come to our meetings several times a month.



## Example volunteer "packages"

This section gives examples of types of packages you can present to
your supervisor to make CodeRefinery a part of your job!  Of course,
we are happy with pure volunteers, but we accept that most people have
another job and if you can get benefits for your job, you'll have much
more time for CodeRefinery.

Clearly, these aren't the only ways to contribute, but we thought that
giving some concrete plans will help people:


### Instructor

As an instructor, you become an expert in CodeRefinery materials by
continual co-working with CodeRefinery staff.  You will really be able
to help all of your staff

Teach at 4/workshops per year (4 × 3 days) + 50% preparation time
commitment.  Attend one CodeRefinery workshop per year.

How to get started: be a helper a few times, then as we are planning
an upcoming workshop, offer to teach something.  We'll help you get
started.


### Helper

As a helper, you have less demands outside of workshops, but you get
to become very familiar with CodeRefinery material.  You especially
get skills in mentoring and debugging.  This is a perfect position for
the "local expert" of a research group, who will guide all of their
members through getting started with scientific computing.  A helper
can include all of our non-instructor roles: helper, expert helper,
Zoom host, etc.

Example time commitment: 4 workshops/year (4 × 3 days) + 20%
preparation time commitment.

How to get started: Watch our announcements and sign up as a helper.


### Lesson maintainer

We have a lot of lessons, and it always helps to have someone keep an
eye on them and make sure issues and pull requests go thorough.  While
theoretically everyone helps with this, it's good to have someone keep
a close watch and make sure there is an overall order to things.  In
return, you get extensive experience in the topic and experience
working on an open source project.

Quite often, the current maintainer is the person who last did a major
re-working of the lesson and an instructor (either active or at the
final limits of their activity).

Example time commitment: 20-50 hours/year/lesson, plus attending our
yearly CodeRefinery workshop and meetings several times a month.

How to get started: Watch the GitHub issues and be the first one to
answer them.  Review pull requests, and if things make sense to you
then submit a review saying "Approved".  Eventually, you become the
recognized specialist.  Ask us or we'll notice, and ask you to become
a maintainer.


### Fan

Hang out in the chat and help others, provide advice to others, give
feedback of our ideas.  Lurk in all of our other activities and decide
if you want to do more later.

Example time commitment: ???

How to get started: join [CodeRefinery zulipchat](./chat) and see what
comes up.


### Organizer

Help us organize workshops.  Handle attendee communication,
advertisement, manage helpers, etc.


### Create your own lessons in our galaxy

While we are focused on a certain type of packaged workshops, we are
in principle welcome to other lessons developed in our galaxy.
