# Contributing to CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.  Also, CodeRefinery is really more of a
group of like-minded people than one particular plan, so you are
welcome to join just to hang out and share ideas.

If you aren't sure you are ready for more, you can always {ref}`lurk
in the chat <chat>`
(passively watch our community) and become more active when you feel
the time is right.

These manuals (and in general, other guides we have) describe the
past, not (only) the future.  They are made so that new people can
know what we typically have done, so they can work on the future (even
if it's different).

A good way to get started is to take the lead of some workshop (doing
it like it was before), then do it again with your own improvements.



## How to take part

- Join the {ref}`CodeRefinery chat <chat>`, give comments or submit
  emoji reactions to show how you feel about things.  Many things are
  announced only through the chat.
- Come to our
  [meetings](https://coderefinery.org/organization/meetings/)- the
  monthly community calls are for a broad audience, but anyone is
  welcome come to the weekly meetings.
- Attend a CodeRefinery workshop - they teach the very tools we use to
  collaborate!



## Action: Join our "community teaching training"

CodeRefinery isn't just about doing teaching ourselves, but improving
your teaching.  Whether you focus on teaching, or it's a side-activity
to your other tasks, the CodeRefinery (online) teaching can help you
avoid re-inventing good practices and prepare you for teaching
together.

## Action: Advertise and/or help out in our online courses

CodeRefinery runs many open, online courses, which anyone can attend.
Some of them can be attended by anyone via livestream, even without
registering (yes, this really works - we get high ratings for this).
You could simply advertise our courses, or go even further and run
local breakout rooms.

Take it a step further and help out with the course, whether it's as
an instructor, helper, or some other role.  Of course, anyone is
welcome to help, even without advertising the courses!

## Action: Teach openly and allow others to join

Go to the next level and adopt CodeRefinery strategies for your own
courses, so that others can join at little cost to yourself.  By
opening, you start to find more lesson developers and instructors, so
that your courses can reach the next level of quality and impact.
Soon, you will wonder why you ever bothered teaching alone.

## Other types of contributions

As an open project, there are any number of ways you can contribute:

- Take on any of the {doc}`roles <roles-overview>` in a workshop - with
  co-teaching, it is surprisingly easy to go straight to instructor,
  but there are also many other roles.
- Help with lesson maintenance (read and make suggestions) or become a
  maintainer of a lesson.  Watch GitHub repositories to get notified
  of issues and pull requests, and help review.  Anyone can watch any
  repository, and comments from outsiders do help us review things faster.
