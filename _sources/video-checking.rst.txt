Video checking OLD
==================

.. note::

   This is old information, these days we use `ffmpeg-editlist
   <https://github.com/coderefinery/ffmpeg-editlist>`__ and ensure
   that no learners are in the videos in the first place.


.. seealso::

   :doc:`video-editing` tells how to edit yourself.  This page
   describes how to check a video for processing.


The purpose of this page is to give video processing volunteers a
starting point.  CodeRefinery produces a lot of videos, and *learner
privacy is important*: we can't post videos until they are checked.
These videos are mainly useful to the learners of the very workshop,
so we need them quickly (and for every workshop).

Overview
--------

* Ask for the directory of videos.  It is on Google Drive or something
  similar, but is not public.
* Look at the tracking issue.  Find a unclaimed section of the course.
* Watch the video.

  * *Carefully* look for any appearances of learner video within the
    video.

* Copy the template below.
* Fill out the template.
* Paste the answers into an issue.

   * [ ] Title: 
   * Filename: 
   * Start: 
   * End: 
   * Segments to cut: 
   * Audience visible: 
   Other notes for channel description:

Example::

   * Title: git-intro basics
   * Filename: day1-obs
   * Start: 25:13
   * End: 45:00
   * Segments to cut: 36:12 - 42:10
   * Audience visible:  none

   Other notes for channel description:

   In this first episode, we go over the basics of using git for a single
   local directory.
   https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/


Why do we ask all this?  It saves time for the person who has to
upload it to YouTube.

* **Title**: what would it be called?  You don't need to include the
  workshop name, someone will add it.
* **Filename**: you don't need the full filename but indicate what
  file you were searching (often we have a recording and backup
  recording for each day)
* **Start**, **end**: start time of the segment

* **Segments to cut**: Segments which should be cut out.  Don't be
  strict, it is better to get it out fast than cut out every 3-minute
  break.  But if there is a ~10 minute break or idle time, then we can
  cut it.

* **Audience visible**: Time periods where any audience (not including
  staff).

* **Other notes for channel description**: Describe the content of the
  video, include any links.  You can think what is useful for someone
  to find this (but it doesn't have to be perfect).



Other comments
--------------

* How small should segments be?  First, it's better for videos to exist
  than be perfect, so the 3-hour segment is better than nothing.  Short
  lessons (1.5 hour) are probably fine to be at once, and long ones (git
  intro/collab) could possibly be each episode separately.  Discuss with
  others to see what you would like.

* Ideally, there are two videos from each day: one recorded by Twitch
  (raw dump of the stream), and one recorded by OBS/Zoom (local
  recording).  The OBS/Zoom recording is preferable.  You can tell
  them apart via the filenames.
