# Practical info, in-person

Dear all,

The CodeRefinery CITY workshop on DATE is approaching! The location and schedule
is available on the workshop webpage: URL

If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible
so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.

You are expected to install some software on your laptops before the workshop
starts. Please visit the workshop webpage (URL) and go through each tool under
"Software requirements", and install whatever you're missing before the workshop
starts. Note that you also need a couple of accounts (GitHub and Read the Docs).
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after
the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).

Don't hesitate to get in touch (support@coderefinery.org) if you run into any
installation problems. We also maintain a list of common installation issues
that can occur at https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/

If you haven't already filled the pre-workshop survey, please do that soon since
it helps us with workshop preparation. You can find it at: URL

The workshop will have a strong focus on version control with Git. Some of you
are already somewhat familiar with Git, but not all. While we will be starting
from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it's useful if you spend
10-20 minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git. For this purpose, we have
prepared this "refresher" material:
https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/

Please have a look at this material before the workshop starts. Note that it
also contains important Git configuration steps which all of you should go
through before the workshop starts, to save valuable time during the workshop.

CodeRefinery strives to follow a Code of Conduct. Please have a look at
https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/ so that
we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!

Best,
Thor
