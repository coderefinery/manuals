# Waiting list

Dear NNN,

thank you for request about the course:

https://coderefinery.org/workshops/COURSE_HERE/
The workshop is currently full but you are placed on the waiting list and I will inform you in case somebody else cancels and a seat frees up.

In case this is too uncertain for you and you make other plans, please let me know.

If you want to make sure to get a seat on the next workshop near you, please register on the "notify-me" list: https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/

We would love to give more courses and hope it works out for you.


Thank you in advance and best wishes,
CCCC
