# Practical info (online)

Dear all,

The online CodeRefinery workshop TITLE is approaching! It will take place on DATE at START - END in Zoom room ZOOMID.
On the first day, we also have an optional session starting half an hour before START where you can connect, 
test your video client and iron out any technical issues (we recommend attending this if you havenâ€™t used Zoom before).

If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.

We will be using a Zoom room with ID ZOOMID. We recommend that you install the Zoom client (https://zoom.us/download). 
In order to join the room you will need the password ZOOMPASSWORD. 
You will be encouraged (but not forced) to use a webcam during the workshop. 
If you don't want the physical room you're in to be visible on the webcam, Zoom allows users to set up a virtual background:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background
You might also be asked to share your screen during group exercises or in interactions with a workshop helper. 
Remember to keep private information away from the screen you share!

You are expected to install some software on your computers before the workshop starts. 
Please visit the workshop webpage WORKSHOPURL and go through each tool under "Software requirements", 
and install whatever you're missing before the workshop starts. Note that you also need to create some accounts.
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).

Don't hesitate to get in touch (support@coderefinery.org) if you run into any installation problems or have questions relating 
to Zoom or other practical details. Note that we maintain a list of common installation issues that can occur at https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/

If you haven't already filled the pre-workshop survey, please do that soon since it helps us with workshop preparation. 
You can find it at: SURVEYURL.

The workshop will be very focused on version control with Git. Some of you are already familiar with Git, but not all. 
While we will be starting from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it's useful if you spend a few minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git. 
For this purpose, we have prepared this "refresher" material: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/
Note that this material also contains important Git configuration steps which all of you should go through before the workshop starts, to save valuable time during the workshop.

CodeRefinery strives to follow a Code of Conduct. Please have a look at

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!
