# Advertising workshop

Dear Professor X,

My name is NAME and I work as a XXX in YYY. I'm contacting you now to spread the word about a workshop which I am co-organizing in LOCATION together with the CodeRefinery project (http://coderefinery.org/) organized under the NeIC organization. I found your contact information via ZZZ...

CodeRefinery (http://coderefinery.org) aims to reach out to diverse academic communities which use and develop software in their research, and advocate more modern and efficient software development methods (such as collaborative distributed version control, automated testing, code documentation, managing code complexity, etc). CodeRefinery is not about efficient code, but rather efficient coding, and experience has shown that researchers have a lot to gain from our course material!

A CodeRefinery workshop is planned for LOCATION in CITY on DATE, see the website here: URL

The most natural audience for our workshops is PhD students and postdocs, but both more junior and senior people may find it valuable to attend.

On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,
NAME
