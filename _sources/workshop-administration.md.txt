# Organizing a CodeRefinery workshop

Anyone can organize a CodeRefinery workshop and teach the CodeRefinery lessons which are
licensed under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
However, making it a successful workshop requires careful planning and preparation. Here we will go
through practical aspects of organizing a workshop.

## Email templates

A collection of email templates:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:glob: true

templates/*
```

When adding new ones, add to an existing page (make a new section)
or.  Try to avoid too much markdown formatting, so that a rendered
version can be copied to plain text email easily still.

## Select a workshop coordinator

One or two persons coordinate the workshop preparation and debrief. This does
not mean that they do all the work - they are encouraged to delegate tasks -
but they make sure that nothing gets forgotten.

  - [advertising workshop via private communication](templates/advertising-workshop)

## Before the workshop

### First steps

- Recruit instructors - having at least 3 instructors is highly recommended.
- Find 1-2 workshop helpers [with an appropriate background](workshop-requirements-inperson.md).
- Reserve dates (coordinate this with the instructors)
- Reserve room
- Select a workshop coordinator
- Workshop coordinator creates a ticket with a checklist on <https://github.com/orgs/coderefinery/projects/4> and takes it (self-assigns)

### Lecture room

- Start looking for an appropriate lecture room early.
- See this [list of requirements](workshop-requirements-inperson.md) for
  the lecture room.

### Set up workshop page

- Import the template at <https://github.com/coderefinery/template-workshop-webpage> to your username
  or the coderefinery organization, and name it like "2019-10-16-somecity".
- Update the required fields in `index.md` and push the commits.
  The page should now be served at *username.github.io/2019-10-16-somecity/*.
- If the workshop will be customized to the needs of a particular audience, modify the schedule accordingly.
- If the workshop should be listed on <https://coderefinery.org>:
  - (Fork and) clone <https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org>
  - Under `coderefinery.org/_workshops/`, add a file named like `2019-10-16-somecity.md` which contains
    the fields permalink, city and dates. For example:
    ```
    ---
    permalink: https://username.github.io/2019-10-16-city/
    city: Somecity
    dates: October 16-18, 2019
    ---
    ```
  - send a pull request with your new file.
- Create a registration form following {doc}`/indico/setup`.
- Open and test registration

### Announcing the workshop

- Twitter
- Email persons who registered to notify-me form
- Use local mailing lists and all channels possible

For self-organized workshops:
- Write an email to support@coderefinery.org to get a pre-workshop survey link and registration form on
  [https://indico.neic.no](https://indico.neic.no)


### Distribute the work

- Make sure lessons are distributed

### Preparing lessons

- Go through the lesson material you will be teaching and think about how you
  intend to teach it, and how much time you will be spending on each episode.
- Are there any unsolved issues that you can fix?
- Go through the instructor guides of the lessons you will be teaching.
  - Review the intended learning outcomes, and try to keep these in mind while teaching.
  - Try to memorize the typical pitfalls and common questions.
- Go through the [lesson presentation hints](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/presenting.md).
- Go through the [helping and teaching guide](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/helping-and-teaching.md),
  and request all helpers to go through it too.

### Prepare practicals

- Order catering (coffee, tea, water, fruit, something sweet, etc.)
- Organize sticky notes
- Organize extension cables if needed
- Organize alternative wireless for those without Eduroam (if any)

### Communication with participants

- Send out practical information, including installation instructions, around 2 weeks ahead.
  [Here is a template](templates/practical-info-to-participants).
- Emphasize that all software should be installed before the workshop starts, and point out
  the [configuration problems and solutions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/).
- Remind registered participants that they are either expected to show up or to cancel participation
- Also ask those without Eduroam to speak up.
- Maintain waiting list if needed
- Make sure we have enough pre-survey answers
- Close registration on the workshop page

### 1-2 weeks before the workshop

- Workshop coordinator organizes a call with all instructors and helpers to discuss the schedule to leave no doubts about timing. Also
  discuss the survey results.
- Point helpers (and instructors) to the [tips for helpers](team-leaders.md).

### Right before the workshop starts

- Prepare a shared Google doc or <https://hackmd.io> with global write permissions,
  consider creating a memorable short-link (e.g. bit.ly)


## Create exercise repositories

- The collaborative Git lesson requires exercise repositories to
  be set up. For this follow the instructor guide in the lesson material.


## Workshop preparation checklist

- This checklist can be set up as an issue under 
  <https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/> or on another
  repository to keep track of the progress
  ```
  - [ ] reserve dates
  - [ ] decide workshop organizer
  - [ ] (online) prepare Zoom link or (in-person) book lecture room
  - [ ] announce (twitter, notify-me, mailing lists)
  - [ ] team of instructors complete
  - [ ] workshop website up
  - [ ] lessons distributed
  - [ ] prepare lessons
  - [ ] create exercise repositories
  - [ ] (in-person) prepare practicals (coffee/tea, sticky notes, extension cacles)
  - [ ] (online) Zoom roles distributed
  - [ ] registration open
  - [ ] team of helpers complete
  - [ ] registration closed
  - [ ] enough pre-survey answers
  - [ ] install instructions sent
  - [ ] pre-workshop briefing held, helper training
  - [ ] survey results shared with co-instructors/helpers
  ```

## As participants arrive

- Emphasize to participants that you need to sit with someone - don't work alone.
- Try to have participants sit next to someone with a similar operating
  system if they have no preference, since they will face similar
  problems.


## Introduction talk

- See <https://github.com/coderefinery/workshop-intro>
- Have a 10 minute ice-breaker session where participants and instructors introduce themselves
  and either describe their research in 2-3 sentences or what they hope to get out of the workshop.


## During workshop

- While teaching, keep [these tips](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/workshop-administration.md#during-workshop) in mind
- Don't start off with tech details, say why this is important.
- Try to [stick to the material](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/presenting.md#try-to-stick-to-the-material),
  although some excursions are useful.
- Keep up interactive feel by encouraging and asking questions
- Keep time
- For presentations which have shell commands, create a
  cheatsheet/reference on the board in real time.
- Remind participants about sticky notes.
- Make sure we take regular breaks (at least a short break each hour)
- Give participants some time to also experiment (do not rush the classroom through exercises)
- Encourage optional feedback at the end of each day or end of each lesson
  on sticky notes. Process the feedback immediately and adjust your teaching
  (pace etc) accordingly
- Create GitHub issues for points which are confusing or problematic
- Take active part even in the lessons you're not teaching, e.g. by asking
  questions and (politely) interject with clarifications when you think
  something is confusing to the learners
- [Wrap up](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/presenting.md#wrap-up),
  say what you taught and why, and what comes next.


## At the end of workshop

- Give credit to those who contributed and helped
- Use <https://github.com/coderefinery/workshop-outro>


## Post-workshop

- Process and distribute feedback to co-instructors and others (e.g. type up in shared document)
- Debrief with instructors
- Process certificate requests

## [Post-workshop survey](https://github.com/coderefinery/post-workshop-survey)

To measure the long-term impact of CodeRefinery workshops it's useful to send out a
post-workshop survey. This survey can identify which topics taught in workshops are
particularly useful and which have less benefits for the participants.
