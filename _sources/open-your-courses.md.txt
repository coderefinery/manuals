# Open your courses to others

CodeRefinery strategies allow you to reach a larger audience without
much extra work from you.  Once you open to other attendees, you also
naturally get *co-instructors* who want to help improve your material.
This allows you to reach the next level of quality and impact, even
for your own local audience.



## Principles

- Thanks to the {doc}`CodeRefinery MOOC strategy <coderefinery-mooc>`,
  you can easily reach more people than you could otherwise.
- It may seem hard, but there are many small steps to take and you can
  gradually scale up.



## How-to

- Learn by example: attend our courses, advertise our courses, and
  {doc}`volunteer <roles-overview>`, too.
- Read all of the manuals here - we try to document everything we
  can, but they are always going to be a work in progress.
- Attend our [train-the-trainer course](https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/) to
  network with others and learn from the experts.
