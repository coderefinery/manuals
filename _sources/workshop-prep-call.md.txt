# Workshop preparation meeting

Each workshop should have a preparation call among instructors,
experts, hosts, etc.  This is separate from the {doc}`helper training
call <team-leaders>`.



## Topics of workshop instructor meeting

- Introduction round
- Go over {doc}`instructor-intro` and other pages in this section
  - New staff: go over in more details.
- The role of {doc}`expert helpers <expert-helpers>`.
- Everyone: discuss the roles in the workshop
- For each lesson, a meeting between a former instructor and the
  current one (even if current one is experienced teaching it).
  - Set up any possible co-teaching arrangements.
- Discuss hand-over times each day
- Breaks should be descussed among instructors for each day, but
  default is 10 minutes between xx:50 and xx:10 each hour.
- Practice instructor tech setup (screenshare, etc): can also be done
  in the one-on-one meeting.
- Joining CodeRefinery: what comes next?



## Don't forget

- Update Zoom client (later than mid-October 2020) for breakout room
  features.  Zoom alone isn't enough.



## Common CodeRefinery conventions to remember

- Breaks are not negotiable, minimum 10 minutes
- Sessions can't be extended indefinitely, it's OK to run out of time
  and skip things (in fact, we expect this: all lessons have op.  All
  lessons have optional episodes.  Not finishing is normal, in fact.
  - Emphasize to learners that we can't cover everything and don't
    expect to.
- During workshop, we communicate via:
  - HackMD
  - Zulipchat
  - Zoom chat is minor and most people don't need to watch.
