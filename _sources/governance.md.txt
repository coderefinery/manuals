# CodeRefinery governance


## CodeRefinery Community

Right now, the CodeRefinery community is small, so we do not want to
make things very formal.  However, we expect things to formalize in
proportion to its need.

In short:

- Team meetings are approximately once a week.  Rough consensus is
  used to make decisions. Read more:
  https://coderefinery.org/organization/meetings/
- Important decisions should also be announced and discussed via chat
  in advance, and ideally at several meetings.
- Because this is a small project, the deciding factor is "what does
  someone want to do?".  Meetings provide a way to empower people to
  take action which may otherwise be hard to find in asynchronous
  chat, despite the {ref}`voting <voting>`.
- The monthly "Community calls" allow us to get a perspective of a
  broader audience and bring in new members.
- This document will be updated (by pull request+discussion) as we
  improve our governance in the future.

In the future:

- An advisory role could to taken on by some sort of community council
  or board made up of partner representatives and community
  representatives.


## NeIC project

The [Nordic e-Infrastructure collaboration](https://neic.no) funds a
part of CodeRefinery, and with that comes a certain standard of
governance and reporting
(see also the [collaboration agreement](https://coderefinery.org/about/reports/phase-3-collaboration-agreement.pdf)).
However, we consider this to be in parallel
to the community project (with the community project being more
important).

There is a lot of overlap between the NeIC-sponsored staff and the
community, but the community will increase in proportion over time.
