# Icebreakers

This is a list of possible icebreaker questions.

You should make it very clear that *everyone* should answer the
question, and thus it should be very broad.  The point is to make sure
they know how to use the tools.  Make sure that the question feels
inclusive - not just that people can answer, but that it doesn't make
people feel they are far behind others.

If you ask people to add there name as part of an introduction, the
document becomes personal data and must be controlled more, and sets
you on a path to extensive editing before it can be released.  Think
before you do this - maybe you just ask for information about
backgrounds without names.
