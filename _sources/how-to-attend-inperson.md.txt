# Attending an in-person workshop

We are glad you would like to attend an in-person workshop.  This page
will help you mentally and physically prepare.

Our workshops are interactive and hands-on, and you will get the most
out of them if you can take part in all exercises, unlike a normal
academic lecture where you mainly listen.  Thus, please read this and
come prepared!



## General prerequisites, software installation, etc.

Check your workshop page for the general setup specific to that
workshop.

- Often, there is something to install.  We usually ask you to install
  things so that your computer is set up to do work later.
- There may be some basic skills, such as the command line shell, to
  review in advance.


If all else fails, join the workshop well in advance and ask
for help then.  Usually, there will be enough time to get ready for
the day.



## Take the workshop seriously

It's easy to think "it's just a class, it's easy to passively watch".
However, for an interactive workshop you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.



## Social

Attend with someone!  Register together and try to sit near them.
This will create a network of learning and practice that will last
much longer.

If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own team leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.



## Computer and equipment

Bring your laptop and charger, of course.  If you use external mice,
etc, it would be good to bring them too.  You'll be on your device a
lot.

Usually, you'll need to look at both the lesson webpage and the window
where you are doing the exercises at the same time.  Consider how you
can arrange windows to do this best.



## Time management

Try your very best to attend the whole workshops; at least don't miss
the early sessions.  Later sessions depend on earlier ones, and it's
easy to get behind.  Tell others this is important so that you can
free your schedule.

Arrive 10 minutes early to get ready.





## Final notes

Arrive 10 minutes in advance to get set-up.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.

There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.
