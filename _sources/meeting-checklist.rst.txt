Meeting checklist
=================

This checklist was made because we had a major issue with *not
announcing good events* to our community because we weren't sure what
to do, thus a community doesn't form.  These steps should be taken to
announce any event unless there is a specific reason not to (for
example, a workshop is well underway and organizers known).  You don't
*have* to follow what you see here, but the point is to make
announcements as boring as possible, so that it gets done quickly and
well-enough.


As soon as meeting topic/time is decided
----------------------------------------

* Decide central HackMD/join link.  (Join link can be decide later by
  putting it in the hackmd).

* Create a calendar event for yourself, and send it to related
  people.  You should be ready to forward this to people who request.
  It's OK if the event only includes HackMD link (+ join link, if
  known).

* [Mailing list: not yet present, we are relying on the other options
  here.]

* Make a post in #events channel.  Don't be shy, just do it.
  ``<time:``\ TAB will produce a time picker that adjusts for
  everyone's timezones.

  ::

     At <time:...>, there will be a [meeting on topic].  Topics will
     include [a few highlights to let people know who should attend].

     HackMD (including connection details): <link>
     More info: #[channel-name]

     If you want a calendar invite, send [me] a private message (or
     react with :email: quickly if I know your email already).

* Make a Twitter post for most meetings, if you want a broader
  community to attend.

  * You can do this yourself via the "tweet-together" Github Action:

    * CodeRefinery:
      https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery-twitter/
    * Nordic-RSE:
      https://github.com/nordic-rse/
    * Research Software Hour: CR + AaltoSciComp

  * You can do it from the web interface, find the "Create new tweet"
    button from the readme.

  * Edit the file path.  It pre-fills ``YYYY/MM`` outside of the text
    box, but you can backspace and change that to current year/month.

  * Suggested template::

      [title] will be held at [time CEST]. [optional: why should
      someone attend?  Attend if...]

      [tags]

  * Suggested tags

    * CodeRefinery: ``#coderefinery``
    * Nordic-RSE: ``#RSEng``
    * Research software hour: ``#RSEng``

  * Ideally, someone else should merge quickly after checking facts
    Don't wait for "permission" or something like that which may never
    come, we agree that more tweeting is a good thing.



Days before the meeting
------------------------
* Send reminders to the #events channel.  You can find the old
  topic and reply to it, quoting the whole text.



Archive meeting agenda
----------------------
* Archive the agenda, if needed.
