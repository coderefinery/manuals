# Zoom Host

This role exists in Zoom workshops, where there is one person in
charge of managing Zoom.  It is most important when there are teams in
breakout rooms - those teams take a lot of time to manage.

WARNING: page out of date, Zoom has been improved so that all co-hosts
can do many things on this page.

- Make all of other staff and expert helpers co-hosts.
- Take attendance in spreadsheet, if we do that.
  - TODO: provide sample spreadsheet
  - It might be easiest to take attendance all at once, in the middle
    of the session, after everyone has been assigned to breakout
    rooms.



## Breakout rooms

- Rename people to include breakout room number (other co-hosts should
  help and hopefully do most of this work too), though.  (this is a
  continuous process as people drop out and rejoin)
- Assign people to breakout rooms (this is a continuous process)
- Merge breakout rooms as necessary, to try to keep them balanced well
- Constantly watch for new people joining, rename them, and assign
  them to breakout rooms.
  - Note, you might have merged the room they were originally in, so
    they might end up in an empty room!
- Plan for the future: how many helpers might be missing, which rooms
  need to be merged.  Can you keep the merging somewhat consistent
  over time?



## Recording

Recording workshops provides a way for learners to get an instant
review of what was covered, increasing learning.  We don't currently
intend for workshop recordings to be useful to new people learning
later, but they could be.

- Record the workshop or give permission for others to record.
  - If you are recording, you can't go to other breakout rooms.
  - Perhaps a separate computer could record?
- Spotlight the current speaker
- dual monitor mode?
- ensure that screen is always being shared?
- stay in speaker view (not gallery view)
- start and stop recording
- rename recording immediately `dayN-lessonname-zoom.mp4` and upload
  to google drive.



## Streaming

(Zoom provided a way to do streaming directly from it, but we don't
use it anymore.)

All of the steps needed to record mean that you can stream, too.  In
fact, you could look at streaming as a side-effect of recording (or a
way to record).

- spotlight speaker
- start streaming
- dual monitor mode?
- ensure that screen is always being shared?
- stay in speaker view (not gallery view)
- have stream feed open.  If you see it change to gallery view, fix it
  immediately.
- stop streaming
- download recording from twitch, rename to
  `dayN-lessonname-twitch.mp4` and upload to google drive.
