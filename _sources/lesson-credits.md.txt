# Lesson credits

```{admonition} Page status

This is a draft/proposal as of 2024.
```

We hope to acknowledge all contributors to our material, but there are
many different sizes of contributions to something as wide-ranging as
CodeRefinery.  We have these levels of credit:

* **Editors** take an overall, long-term view, set the overall
  strategy, and manage the fit of the various sections.  They merge
  pull requests (but so can others).
* **Contributors/Authors** have made contributions which are locally
  significant to one part of the lesson, and take responsibility for
  what they have added (along with the team).
* **Acknowledgees** have made other contributions.

Editors and contributors are listed in the `CITATION.cff` file within
each repository and are includes as authors in the archived DOI in
Zenodo.  Editors are usually mentioned in the README file itself.
Acknowledgees are listed on the Github contributors pages (or
READMEs if it's not via Github).


## Adding an author

If you have been linked here, you might have been asked if you want to
be listed as an author.  If someone has asked you, then don't worry if
you contribution is enough: the threshold is not high.  If so,
consider:
- Your name and info will be included in the Zenodo citation, which is
  permanent
- You will be included in future releases as well, unless you ask to be removed
- Please send us: family-names, given-names, and if you want ORCID
  ((reference of valid
  keys)[https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#definitionsperson]).

Editors should be proactive reach out to people when they contribute,
but everyone should also send a pull request to be included in
CITATION.cff if you desire.  Note that nothing of the above is defined
as only "git or in-writing contributions".



## Adding an acknowldegee

There are very many, so we try to leave the Github contributions page
as the main source of them.  They can also be added to the lesson
README page if it's not a Github interaction (or if it's desired for
some other reason).



## Adding an editor

Anyone is welcome to take a long-term view of the lesson to become a
future editor.  Be active in Github/chat/our meetings/etc. and we will
be happy to distribute the work and credit more.
