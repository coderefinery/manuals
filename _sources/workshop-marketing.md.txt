# Workshop marketing

The workshop marketing and outreach coordinator makes sure (by delegation) that the workshops are advertised in all known channels.
They also coordinate mass communications with all entities of the workshop.

Some thoughts on target groups that should be tried to be reached:

- Learners (many sub-categories with different time vs need trade-offs: students, junior researchers, senior researchers, lifelong learning) (join a workshop)
- team leaders (bring your friends, join to learn more and lead groups)
- Research leaders (people who can tell their students they need to attend CR)
- University staff (Computing, open sci, etc.) (people who can serve as local organizers and serve as local helpers)
- Potential instructors (teach, etc.)
- High-level management (provide us funding)

You can find a list of commonly advertised places in the bottom of the {doc}`workshop-checklist`.
