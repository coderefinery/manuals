# Instructor screenshare

You have to assume the smallest screen from learners and plan for
that.  You should share a **portrait** screen: either a portion of
your screen, or one window in portrait mode.  See the examples below.

- Learners have a small screen, and need room for their own terminals
  and web browser open, too.  A big screen or multiple monitors is
  the special case.
- Sharing a 1920x1080 screen is not a good idea: you need to make all
  the text size large so that learners can scale it down to have room
  to do their work.  Pixels are wasted.  **Instead, force yourself to
  save space by using a normal font size but sharing less of your
  screen.**
- Zoom now has a "share portion of screen" (Screen sharing → Advanced
  → Share a portion of the screen).
- For livestreaming, our aspect ration is 840×1080 (**portrait**).
  This is a bit less than half your screen.  This is 43% of the width
  of your screen and the full height, for a standard FullHD screen.

When streaming/recording: **Never stop sharing a screen, ask someone
else to take it over, or wait for the view to switch to Notes**.  When
you stop screensharing, the window reverts to "gallery" or "active
speaker" view which appears directly on stream, which isn't ideal.

This image can be used as a desktop background to align "share portion
of screen".  The lighter grey part is what can be shared at our
portrait-mode ratio.  Beware and adjust if the title bar covers part
of the light grey area.

## Screen share examples

These are layouts of the actual screen or portion of screen being
shared:

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/screenshare-fullhd.png
:width: 75%

**S1**: A FullHD 1920x1080 screen shared.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/screenshare-vertical.png
:width: 50%

**S2**: A vertical screen layout shared.  Note the extra shell history at the
top.  The web browser is at the bottom, because the Zoom toolbar can
cover the bottom bit.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/screenshare-jupyter.png
:width: 50%

**S3**: A sort-of GUI (Jupyter) shared vertically.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/screenshare-rsh.png
:width: 75%

**S4**: This isn't a screenshare from CodeRefinery, but may be instructive.
Note the horizontal layout and shell history at the bottom right.
```

```{figure} img/screenshare/s5-shell-intro-dark.png
:width: 75%

**S5**: Similar to above, but dark.  Includes contents on the right.
```

```{figure} img/screenshare/s8-modular-code-development.png
:width: 50%

**S8**: Jupyter + terminal, including the ``fish`` shell and the
terminal history.
```

```{figure} img/screenshare/s9-git-intro.png
:width: 50%

**S9**: Similar to S8.  Lesson + terminal, ``tmux`` plus terminal history
and dark background.
```

```{figure} img/screenshare/s10-kickstart-prompt-log.png
:width: 50%

**S10**: HPC Kickstart course.  Note the colors contrast of the
windows and colors of the prompt and text.  The history is smaller and
doesn't take up primary working space.  The working directory is
in the window titlebar.
```


## Screen layout: learners

This is how learners can arrange their screen:

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/learner-largescreen.png
:width: 75%

**L1**: Learner with a large screen, Zoom in dual-monitor mode so that the
instructur pictures are not shown.  Screenshare is on the left side,
HackMD at bottom left, terminal and web browser on the right.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/learner-normal.png
:width: 75%

**L2**: A learner with a single large screen (Zoom in "single monitor mode").
Instructor screen share at right, learner stuff at left.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/learner-small.png
:width: 75%

**L3**: A learner with a particularly small screen.  Instructur screenshare at
left, your windows at right.
```

## Screen layout: instructors

This is what the instructor sees on their screen:

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-online/instructor.png
:width: 75%

**I1**: Vertical instructor setup.  Zoom is sharing a portion of the left
side, the right side is free for following HackMD, chat, etc (but
don't overload yourself).
```
