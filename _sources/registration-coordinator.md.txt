# Registration coordinator

The registration coordinator is responsible for the Indico registration page and the workshop homepage.
Usually the registration coordinator has the best position for sending emails. Drafting can be collaborated with outreach and marketing coordinator.
They keep and eye on the Helpdesk before, during and after every workshop and make sure everyone is registered and knows where to go.
After the workshop, they make sure the CodeRefinery webpage is up-to-date and all changes needed in the planning HackMD are ported to the template.
The registration coordinator also has the overview over statistics for reporting and adds those to the webpage after the workshop.
