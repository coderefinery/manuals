# Exercise coordinator

Also called team leader coordinator.

The exercise coordinator makes sure that the hands-on idea of the workshop is preserved. They remind the instructors to check and report their exercises before the workshop. They are also the contact person for the team leaders and organize the team leader onboarding before the workshop.

If wished, they can also host the exercise Zoom room and support the registration coordinator with building the teams for the breakout rooms in Zoom.
