# Attending an livestream workshop

We are glad you would like to attend an livestream workshop.  This page
will help you prepare and get the most out of the workshop and take
advantage of the diverse ways to attend.

Even though it's a one-to-many livestream, the course is still
interactive.  In fact, it's more interactive, since everyone can Q&A
at the same time via {doc}`HackMD <hackmd-mechanics>`.  Since we can
record without privacy risk, you are better able to catch up and
review.  Read on to learn more.

- You might register to Zoom breakout rooms, which *are* interactive.
- {doc}`HackMD <hackmd-mechanics>` allows you to ask questions anonymously -
  even better than a normal workshop!  Once we have a few tens of people in
  any workshop, people don't ask voice questions anyway.
- In some workshops, you can register for breakout rooms to get
  interactive assistance during the exercise/breakout sessions.



## How it works

- You open the livestream in a web browser.  This is the "TV", it is
  always on (but sometimes silent).
- If you are part of an exercise/breakout group, be with them.  The
  stream will tell you when the exercise/collaboration times are, and
  you go to there.
  - If you are attending Zoom exercise session, open this at the
    beginning.  Leave it minimized when it's not active.
  - If you are with an in-person group, be together.  When the stream
    is quiet, you can interact freely.

- The livestream is a portrait screenshare, so that it will only take
  up half of your screen (and the other half is for you to work).  (If
  you are in a physical meeting room with a projector or second
  monitor, it can be half the livestream and half the HackMD - this
  will make sense when you see it).

## General prerequisites, software installation, etc.

Check your workshop page for the general setup specific to that
workshop.

- Often, there is something to install on your own computer.  (We
  usually ask you to set up your own computer, so you can continue
  working independently later.)
- There may be some basic skills, such as the command line shell, to
  review in advance.

**Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
it.**  Our instructions are standard enough that someone local should
be able to help you, if some central install help isn't provided.  The
livestream can't wait for individual people (but a local group can
provide live support).



## Take the workshop seriously

It's easy to think "it's just online, it's easy to passively watch".
And that is OK!  We'd rather have someone watch in case it might be
useful, than exclude people who don't have time.  Our material is
available for later.  In this case, please don't register for our
Zoom/in-person sessions, since that can take a spot from others.

However, we design the workshops to be interactive, and there is a lot
of time scheduled for hands-on work and Q&A.  Reading this page and
preparing will help you to make the most of it: *don't do multiple
meetings*, *reserve the entire timeslots on your calendar*, *attend
every session*, *do the preparation*.




## Social

Attend with someone!  Register together and try to be in their same
group.  You could even reserve a room and work together.  This will
create a network of learning and practice that will last much longer.

If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own exercise leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.



## Workspace

Get a good, quiet workspace.  Make sure it is comfortable enough to
stay at for a while.

An extra monitor is useful but not required, since there is a lot of
stuff to follow: the stream itself, the lesson webpage, and the window
where you are doing the assignment.  You could also use a second
device to watch the stream.  However, we do design things to fit on
one computer.

If you have registered to attend breakout rooms, you'll be expected
to talk at some times and take part, not simply be
quiet and listen all the time.  Try to be in a place where you can
speak without disturbing others.  By the same token, you'll be
listening for a long time, and your ears may get tired of headphones.
If you have good enough external speakers, be somewhere that you can
use them (perhaps only sometimes - when it doesn't interfere with your
microphone.)

If you work in a large office, consider attending from home or in a
meeting room so that you can speak and listen more freely.  If you
need and extra monitor or more comfortable seating space and don't
have that at home, consider working at your office.  Yes, these are
conflicting ideas, you need to find what works best for you.



## Time management

Paying attention to something requires time, whether it is online or
in-person.

Don't schedule overlapping meetings, reserve the entire timeslots,
minimize distractions.  It's easy to think you can do multiple things
at once when doing it online, but really it's a trap.

Plan to join the stream 10 minutes early to get ready - we start with
icebreakers and discussion then.

There will be breaks, but even long ones go by very fast, and this
gives you limited time to make coffee, eat, etc.  We try to limit
ourselves to half-days because of this, but consider preparing food,
coffee, etc. in advance.

Make sure you take the breaks, walk around some, etc.



## Communication

Most communication goes through [HackMD](hackmd-mechanics). Make sure
that you open it and try it out during the icebreakers - it will
become obvious then.  There will be an absolute flood of information
there, so watch strategically and don't let yourself get overloaded.

HackMD is much better than chat, since you can ask *anonymously*, you
can ask *at the same time as others*, and *multiple people can
answer*, and *we fix it up and publish it at the end*.



## Final notes

Join the stream 10 minutes in advance.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.

There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.
