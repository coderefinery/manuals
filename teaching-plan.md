# Teaching plan

Try to make a written teaching plan that goes over what you'll cover.
This helps to keep on topic (not going off on tangents and running
over time) and making sure you cover everything.  The plan is very
related to {doc}`team-teaching`, since the plan is the written record
of how you plan on team-teaching (who does what at each time).

## Example plan

See this link, which includes description of how it works:
<https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/2025kickstart-tritondemos>

This plan format has worked well in the past.  It worked very well,
because:

- It has outline and timing - agreed with instructors.
- Has everything that need to be said and typed - no surprises,
  nothing left out.
- Allows us to avoid saying too much - we try very hard not say
  anything we haven't prepared (other than audience questions of
  course).
  - We don't read/follow the lesson paragraph-by-paragraph.  Learners
    can do that on their own time if they want (for example during the
    exercise time or after the course).
- It is very closely aligned to the lesson: ideally, each
  heading/chunk in the plan corresponds to one section.  When we get
  to that section, we scroll to it, and instead of reading from the
  lesson page, we talk according to the plan.
- It isn't *that* much work to prepare.
- It forces us to test every command in advance.
  - If a lesson has the exact command you run it it, it's not
    necessary to make another copy.  Though it may not hurt.
- We can still easily adapt the exact words we say to the need.
- We don't have read the lesson word-for-word.

## Recommendations

- Make a plan suitable for your needs - not too much, not too little.
- In particular, it shouldn't be too much: spontaneous is good.
- It doesn't need to have everything you need to say, just broad
  bullet points, roles, and timing.
- Exact commands may be useful if time is very limited, but if they
  are in the lesson, you should just follow that.
