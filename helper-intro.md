# Helper introduction

Thanks for being a CodeRefinery helper!  Helpers allow CodeRefinery to
scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.  You'll be
in a breakout room with around 5 people, guide them through the
course, keep time, and call us when more help is needed.  You'll also
learn to be
a more effective teacher and mentor.

As a helper, you are expected to:

- Show a positive, motivating attitude to learners.

- Come to a one-hour "helper training" before the workshop.

- Prerequisites: Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used git some
  since then, or have a bit more some experience with git (branching,
  pull request, github) and command line work.  Be able to focus
  during the course.

- *You do not have to know everything*, but keep exercises going and
   call us when there are difficult questions!


## Helper training

During this time, we will talk about the role of the helper during the
workshop and answer any open questions you may have.  We'll go through
the material below.

If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell
us apart from these sessions, please ask!  We are here to help.  Our
general email is <support@coderefinery.org> or you can join the
{doc}`CodeRefinery chat <chat>` (we recommend the `#workshops` stream,
and if you can't find it then `#general` is good).


## Reading

We have these things we recommend you read in advance (don't worry,
we'll go over them in helper training):

- [Basics of being a good, motivating helper](helping-and-teaching)
- {ref}`How breakout rooms work <breakout-helpers>`, focused on
  sections for helpers.


You'll learn these during the workshop so *you don't need to read
these in advance* (and if you've been to a CodeRefinery before, you'll
know this):

- [HackMD mechanics](hackmd-mechanics)
- [Zoom mechanics](zoom-mechanics)
- It is not bad to read hints on [how to attend
  online](how-to-attend-online) or [how to attend
  in-person](how-to-attend-inperson), but you learn this in class.
