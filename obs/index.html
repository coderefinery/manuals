<h1>Open Broadcaster Software theory<a class="headerlink" href="#open-broadcaster-software-theory" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This page describes the theory around OBS.  For practical steps to
run a course, see <a class="reference internal" href="../broadcaster/"><span class="doc">Broadcaster</span></a>.</p>
<p>Open Broadcaster Software is an amazing open-source audio/video
production tool.  It’s probably not professional grade, but is used in
serious events and will make a non-professional feel professional.
The main point is that, instead of being limited to what your meeting
software can do, you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>create more advanced mixes of screens/video/etc, without having to
do post-processing.</p></li>
<li><p>do more with the (local recording, streaming)</p></li>
<li><p>do this all better, for example, exclude the audience speaking from
the recording.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a GUI application, so is not that hard to figure out, but there are a
lot of initial concepts.  This page isn’t a comprehensive tutorial,
but will introduce the basic concepts and what you can get out of it,
and you can either figure out the rest or read other tutorials.</p>
<div class="section" id="vision">
<h2>Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#vision" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When teaching online, we are usually limited by our online meeting
software.  This forces us to make certain trade-offs to fit the
limitations of the software, so that we can’t reach our full
potential.  By using more advanced technology, we can do more: have
interactive sessions while also recording and preserving privacy.  For
more information, see the <a class="reference internal" href="../online/"><span class="doc">online teaching guide</span></a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Open Broadcasting Software (OBS)</dt><dd><p>OBS, whose current implementation is known OBS Studio.  It is a
multi-platform audio/video mixer, recorder, and streamer.  It
doesn’t do any editing, but you can flexibly mix stuff when
producing for a one-shot product.</p>
</dd>
<dt>streaming</dt><dd><p>Media which is delivered to the user continuously.  The term
implies over the Internet.</p>
</dd>
<dt>livestreaming</dt><dd><p>Streaming of source that is live, delivered in near real-time.
Lately, it is popularized by livestreaming games and other
activities, which provides us a lot of accessible tools to use.</p>
<p>Livestreaming tools have opened a significant way for anyone to
be able to interact in real-time with a large audience online.</p>
</dd>
<dt>recording</dt><dd><p>Saving the streaming data locally for later use.  And other
stuff, you probably know this.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Twitch</dt><dd><p>A popular livestreaming site.  Popular with gamers, but has all
kinds of live-streaming events.</p>
</dd>
<dt>codec</dt><dd><p>COding and DECoding.  As a noun, the algorithm used to encode
and decode sound or video.  There are many different codecs,
with different properties of
compression, CPU usage, etc.  The codec is independent of the
program actually used to encode/decode, and also (somewhat, not
entirely) independent of the container format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>container format</dt><dd><p>File format that contains the audio/video data.  There are
different formats, and the container format is independent of
the codec of the material inside (but not all codecs work in all
containers).  There are containers for both streaming and
recorded media.</p>
</dd>
<dt>encoder</dt><dd><p>The program that compresses raw video to the codec for
distribution.  Of course, there are also decoders.  You need the
right decoder for each codec, but most things you would use
these days are widespread.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bitrate</dt><dd><p>Amount of data of the media stream over time.  Usually measured in
Megabits (not bytes, also note the actual unit is
Megabit/second).  As an example,
Netflix on mainstream “high” quality is about 5 Mbit, and Twitch
recommends ~6 Mbit at most.  Netflix on low quality is about .7
Mbit, but of course all these are for movies, not relatively
static screenshares.</p>
<p>The more movement in a scene, the more bitrate required to
encode that at a constant quality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constant bitrate (CBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where the bitrate does not vary over time.
There is only a small encoding buffer to handle times with a
large amount of movement.</p>
<p>Twitch and other live streaming sites recommend CBR because of
the way the Internet works.  With a live stream, a constant
stream of data is needed.  Internet congestion
control protocols can keep a constant stream going when the
stream is constant.  If
there is a sudden increase in instantaneous bitrate (with VBR
and a section with lots of movement), congestion control
not be able to keep up and buffers empty, causing lag.</p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to other playback modes, such as
embedded devices with limited CPU power, thus the idea of
encoding “targets” (profiles optimized for certain classes of
devices).  Mainstream personal computers tend to have enough
power to decode anything, so this isn’t a major consideration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>variable bitrate (VBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where instantaneous bitrate varies depending on
how much information is needed at each instantaneous point of
time, to encode the complexity of the current scene.  In x264,
this is usually done as “CRF”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>latency</dt><dd><p>Time delay between two events.  In a livestream, time delay
between the performer’s actions and the audience seeing it.
This is caused by countless buffers: encoding buffer, network
buffers, network transmission time, decoding buffer, etc.  Lower
latency increases performance demands on the hardware and
network, so you need to strike a balance.</p>
<p>On Twitch, “low latency mode” gives you 10-15 seconds of latency.</p>
</dd>
<dt>x264</dt><dd><p>A common open-source encoder.  Used as an internal encodign
backend for many different programs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>x264 → crf</dt><dd><p>In x264, a variable bitrate encoding mode (constant rate
factor).  Values are between 0 and 51, but reasonable values are
low 20s.  For example, 23 is the default and looks good for all
practical purposes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Real-time messaging protocol (RTMP)</dt><dd><p>A common protocol for live
streaming.  It is proprietary, but was later opened and is now
one of the main standards.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)</dt><dd><p>The other common streaming protocol.</p>

<p>OBS is a graphical program.  Once you start it up, you see various
user interface features:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Basic OBS control layout</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Of primary note are the following concepts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Preview area</dt><dd><p>Shows what is currently being broadcasted or recorded, or will be
if you turn it on.  There is also a separate “Studio mode” with a
preview area, and live area.  The preview area is used to prepare
the stream, you can make it live when you want.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scenes</dt><dd><p>A certain layout that can be broadcasted.  On the lower left is
your scene collection, and you can add, delete, reorder, and rename
scenes.  By clicking on a scene, you switch to it and it begins
broadcasting/recording.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sources</dt><dd><p>An image source which can be composed together in a scene.  Scenes
can be added, deleted, recorded.  Via the preview area, sources can
be graphically moved around to your liking.  There is a
comprehensive set of positional and image effect transforms you can
make.</p>
<p>Sources can have <strong>filters</strong> applied to them, which do some sort of
video transformation (for example, background removal).  There are
also <strong>transformations</strong>, which affect the position in the scene.
Put together, you can do almost anything you would like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Audio sources</dt><dd><p>You can take audio input from various sources: mainly, microphones
or as a monitor of a computer audio device (to, for example, play
sound).  Audio sources are configured in settings, but can be
muted/have volume adjusted in the respective area of the screen.</p>
<p>Audio sources also have <strong>filters</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control buttons</dt><dd><p>There are buttons to start/stop recording/streaming.  The output
locations are configured in the settings.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Here, we will go over the main parts of configuration.  We won’t say
everything, since this is graphical program and you can mostly click
around and find your own customization you would like.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of streaming, it is easy to find more
tutorials and recommendations for anything here.  Add “streaming” or
“OBS” to your search.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-configuration">
<h3>Basic configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>These options are found in the “Settings” dialog.  These are just
generally suggested defaults and when you might want to tone them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>File → Settings → Stream</dt><dd><p>Here, you would configure the streaming service, if any.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Output</dt><dd><p>Here, you configure streaming/recording output parameters.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>Simple</strong>, you pretty much can’t go wrong.  If you are
mainly screensharing and don’t have much action video, you can
make the bitrate much lower, for example 1500 Kbps.  The slower
“encoder preset” is, the more CPU power that will be spent to get
that quality, so the less space it will use.  The better your CPU
is, the slower you can make it; “fast” to “slow” are reasonable.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>advanced</strong> you have more options:</p>
<p>Streaming: Rate control=CBR, 1500 Kbps, other options don’t matter
so much, defaults should be fine.  You can search for
recommendations online, but realize that most others stream
high-action games so their settings are much higher than you need.</p>
<p>Recording: Recording format, mkv (mp4 is completely unusable if
the recording dies, mkv can be uploaded to youtube if it has a
supported coder inside of it). Encoder=x264,
Rate control=CRF, CRF=22, Keyframe interval=auto, CPU
preset=medium (or slower, for better CPUs)
(slower=use more CPU to do better
encoding, either higher quality or lower bitrate.  Veryfast–Slow
is a good range),
Profile=main, Tune=None</p>
<p>If you use the streaming encoder for the recording, then it will
only have to encode it once and it will save CPU power.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Video</dt><dd><p>Here, you set the base size of the picture you will be using.
You could do FullHD at 1920x1080.  For vertical
recording, we recommend you do 840x1080.  Use your chosen value
for both Base and Output resolutions.  30 FPS.</p>
<p>When setting your video size, traditionally people tell you to be
as large as possible (to attract viewers).  However, this guide is
focused on teaching
and learning, and for that a) we want our content to be as
accessible as possible.  There is no need for as many pixels as
possible, as we often say “present from your smallest screen”, and
you can do that by artificially restricting yourself.  b) We have
found a vertical screen works well: a learner can have the
video/stream taking up half of their screen, and the other half
available for doing their own work.</p>

</dl>
<p>Click around through the other menus in settings and see if there is
anything to configure to your own needs.</p>

<div class="section" id="scene-configuration">
<h3>Scene configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>After the above, you can set up scenes basically however you would
like.  However, as a starting point I propose these scenes to get you
started (and I propose we standardize on these names, so that we
can make some uniform scripting tools):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Title</strong>, the logos and titles of the event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gallery</strong>, a gallery of the people presenting (or the one).  When
presenting from a Zoom meeting, this is a capture of the gallery
view in dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Screenshare</strong> is a screenshare by someone remote.  If you are capturing
from a Zoom meeting, it is the capture of the second window of the
dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BroadcasterScreen</strong> is a local screenshare, that you get by capturing your own
screen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong> is some HackMD or other material you might want to show
during discussion periods or breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Common types of sources (scene elements) include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Static image (e.g. logo or background)</p></li>
<li><p>Desktop capture, for your local desktop.  You can crop it (in the
source config) to share only a portion of your desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Single-window capture.  Note that this is smarter than Zoom,
since it can capture the full window even if is not on top.</p></li>
<li><p>Text (which works, but is not very powerful)</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The sources themselves can be moved around graphically, which is good for
setting things up.  When there are more demanding needs, the source
transformation can be edited for more precise control (right click on
source in preview → edit transformation).  There are
source <em>filters</em>, which can do video effects such as removing a color.
Some sources can be cropped in the source-specific config as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="audio-configuration">
<h3>Audio configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#audio-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Audio configuration is simpler than video configuration, since there
are fewer different sources.  On the other hand, it is harder to
see what is going on (no preview) so it is harder to adjust it
perfectly, and easier to cause problems like loops.</p>
<p>The main concept is that your computer may have different input and
output sound devices (“cards”).  For example, I can output sound from
some application on my monitor’s speakers, while sound from other
applications on the headphones at the same time.  Find your computer’s
way to see and configure what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>There are two types of audio inputs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Microphones</strong>, obviously recording from a microphone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitors</strong> (as in, monitor a sound card), recording what is
currently being played on another
sound card.  This is what is used to capture audio from a remote
meeting, such as Zoom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You set the active audio input in the application settings.  The
volumes of these can be independently adjusted - you want typical
volume to be in the yellow zone.  Advice for various operating systems
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linux using PulseAudio: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pavucontrol</span></code> (GUI) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pulsemixer</span></code>
(terminal)</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: ???</p></li>
<li><p>MacOS: ???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under “advanced audio properties” (a menu item, also available from
the gear icon in the audio area) you have several more options.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can add various filters, such as noise reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>You can group audio sources into various <strong>audio tracks</strong>, and the
stream/recordings can use different tracks.  For example, a person
may stream with music but leave that out of the recorded video.  Or,
you might record a video with two different audio tracks, one just
the presenter and one with presenter + audience.</p></li>
<li><p>You can monitor the audio, which plays what is being recorded back
over the headphones and speakers for you to check.  Make sure you
don’t make any loops!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Audio configuration is a big deal.  You can look at these other
guides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../instructor-audio/"><span class="doc">Instructor audio</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>High-quality audio is quite important.  I’ve spent far too long
playing with it, and my conclusion is that I don’t know enough to make
it better than what I have now.  What I know is in the “instructor
audio” page linked above.  I propose a central
recommendation: <em>talk about audio quality</em>.  Start meetings early and
test it.  Communicate about problems early, don’t ignore and think
it’s “good enough for now”.</p>

<div class="section" id="recording-and-streaming">
<h3>Recording and streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-and-streaming" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once you have done the above, you can record and stream by clicking
the buttons.</p>
<p>One piece of advice: always keep the recording going, and then
stop/restart it when you need to cut.  It’s easier to delete the
unnecessary segments than realize you forgot to push “record”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projector-and-loopback-output">
<h3>Projector and loopback output<a class="headerlink" href="#projector-and-loopback-output" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Beyond recording and streaming, there are several more ways to use the
output that can feed into other applications.</p>
<p>With <strong>projectors</strong> you can display the scene locally on another
monitor or window.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>fullscreen projector</strong> displays the scene to a monitor.  As
the name says, this could be used to send it to an external
projector or capture card via HDMI.  Or even preview locally, or
screenshared in an online meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>windowed projector</strong> does similar, but makes a new window that
can be moved and resized.  This can be captured as a single-window
screenshare in an online meeting.  Or it can be a smaller preview of
the scene if the main OBS window is too large for your space.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>loopback output</strong> creates a <strong>virtual camera device</strong>.  This
appears to other applications as a camera, just like the camera that
captures your video.
Other applications can use this as the input just like another
webcam.  So, you could make a fancy scene that is used instead of your
normal camera’s picture.
Or, in Zoom you can share screen from “second camera” -
which would use this scene.  (Note in Zoom it will interpret it as a
landscape picture, regardless of what aspect ration you actually use.
Thus, this isn’t very suitable for vertical screen sharing.)</p>

galleryCapture in top-right corner</p></li>
<li><p>Screenshare: capture of Zoom second window (which has been

galleryCapture in top-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Notes: contains HackMD + galleryCapture</p></li>
<li><p>galleryCapture - contains the Zoom gallery capture.  This gets

</ul>
<p>Audio:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Microphone capture</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor of sound card which has the Zoom output</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Recorded locally.  Start and restart recording after every
transition that you would want to publish separately. (Better to cut
more than less, to have logically organized shorter segments.  Also,
always keep it recording, in case you forget to turn it back on!).</p></li>
<li><p>Stream to your preferred site.</p></li>
<li><p>Use windowed projector or Zoom capture to send the output directly
to a Zoom meeting.  But, that requires careful audio routing.</p></li>
