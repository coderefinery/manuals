# Indico hints

## Emailing people

```{warning}
Emailing registrants directly out of Indico risks that emails go into
spam folders.

Alternative is to export the list of addresses into a CSV file and
to import the addresses into your institutional email system as BCC.
```

* Go to registration list
* Filter people based on who you need
* Select all (this selects only the visible people; you can confirm
  this by looking at the names in the email box, though you can't see
  them all our count them)
* Actions â†’ Email
* Compose your email (warning: it is easy to lose everything, there is
  no saving)
* Preview email to make sure it works
* **Ensure that it is sent from support@coderefinery.org**
  * If you want a real test, you could register and send the first
    draft to yourself (make sure you copy the full text first,
    otherwise you lose the placeholders)
* **Copy full text before you send the email**, otherwise you lose the
  form fields.
* Click send
* Don't worry
