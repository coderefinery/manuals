# Instructor audio

Audio quality, and balance between instructors, is *absolutely
critical* to good online work, especially teaching.  Consider the
following:

* Can you adjust your microphone volume from very low to
  higher-than-needed?  Make sure your dynamic range is larger than
  "barely working", so that you have some room to adjust for later.
* Do you have a high-quality headset?  A headset with microphone is
  the most reliable, but if you can get a desktop setup working
  well, that can be good too.  Always have a high-quality headset for
  backup anyway.

  * If you don't, and are employed to do CodeRefinery teaching, ask
    your employer to provide you a headset meeting these criteria.

* If you have a bluetooth headset, consider:

  * Bluetooth headsets have significant latency compared to wired or
    purpose-built wireless protocols like gaming headsets have.
  * The microphone might not have enough bandwidth (if it's part of
    the same headset).
  * Bluetooth 5 is much better in both latency and quality.
  * Consider investing (or getting your work to invest in) some
    high-quality headset or desktop audio gear.
  * **Recommendation: Don't use a bluetooth headset.  Tell your
    employer you need something for meetings.**

* "Ducking" is when the first words are silenced/quieted by noise
  cancellation, until it detects speaking.  To avoid this, don't use
  "high" noise cancellation (as low as possible is better, reduce
  environmental noise / use headset mic instead).  If you
  need high cancellation because of background noise, switch to your
  headset.
* Set your microphone's hardware volume to something relatively high -
  and control via the software.
