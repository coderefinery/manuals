# Instructor technical setup

```{seealso}
* {doc}`instructor-tech-online` for screen sharing layouts.
```

```{admonition} Final checklist
- Have you moved your configurations away and done the course setup
  instead (or left it unconfigured)?: `.bashrc` (or equivalent),
  `.gitconfig`, `.ssh`, `.conda`, etc.
- Are you using a software environment as described in the workshop
  instructions (conda, virtualenv, etc).  Is it clean and without
  extra stuff installed?
- Is your setup as boring-looking as possible, if you are teaching at
  the beginning of the workshop?  The first sessions aren't the time
  for distractions.
- Is your terminal
  - Dark text on light background? (if not: create a profile so you
    can switch now or in the future)
  - Do you know key-bindings to change the font size quickly?
- Do you have command history set up?  If in doubt, use
  [prompt-log](https://github.com/rkdarst/prompt-log/) and `tail` the
  output in a separate smaller window.
- Do you have a clean web browser session (different profile for
  demos)?
- If you use an advanced shell, do you have a simpler shell (bash) set
  up for the demos?
- (if online) have you practiced Zoom screensharing "Share a portion
  of the screen" in portrait-mode?  See
  {doc}`instructor-tech-online`.
- (if online) have you checked your audio settings?  Join a test
  meeting with someone and understand your microphone sound
  adjustments.  Can you control it for the full range from very quiet
  to very loud, so that you can make whatever adjustments needed?  Is
  your best microphone/headset ready? *Audio quality and balance is
  critical.*
- Have you shown your setup to someone else for feedback?
```

Appearance matters.  When you look at other professionally made videos
online, they look good.  As a presenter, you also need to work to make
your screen look pleasing to the eye.  It also has to be similar to a
learner's screen, so that they are not distracted with your different
configuration or appearance.



## Simple or fancy screen?

As a teacher of tech, you also
*need to make sure that your screen supports the learning process*:
you have conflicting goals of:

* Making your screen look simple, to not distract from what you are
  trying to teach, and
* Showing more advanced setups, so that others can learn and improve.

In general, try to use a simpler arrangement at the beginning of
workshops.  You, or other teachers, can begin showing more advanced
screen layouts once learners are able to see what is important and
what is extra.



## Check with someone before you start teaching

**Most importantly, get your setup done well in advance and show your
co-teachers for feedback.  Feedback and time to improve is very
important to make things beautiful.**



## Clean your environment

Do you have fancy ``.bashrc``, ``.gitconfig``, etc files?  Move them
away so that you are as plain and normal as possible - beyond
appearances, you don't want to use any shortcuts that every learner
won't have access to (telling learners to add some configuration won't
work - some will miss it and be lost, or worse their system may have a
weird behavior in the future).

Relevant files that are sometimes a problem:

* ``.bashrc``
* ``.gitconfig``
* ``.ssh/config``, ``.ssh/authorized_keys``
* ``.conda/*``
* Any config for any program you will be demonstrating



## Arrange your windows well

This is mostly the topic of {doc}`instructor-tech-online` (our
recommendations for in-person window arrangements aren't so
up-to-date, but the same principles apply but you have a widescreen
view).

- For online teaching, you will want to screenshare a portion of your
  screen: half the screen in "portrait mode" so that the other half is
  available.  See {doc}`instructor-tech-online`.



## Desktop environment

- Is your overall desktop environment "normal"-looking?
- Do your window title bars take up lots of space?  Is it possible to
  reduce their size for the teaching - you want as much space for
  large fonts as possible.
  - Since you will only be sharing a portion of the screen, or have a
    lower-resolution projector, these title bars take up more space
    relative to the content.
- Same for desktop menu bars, etc.
- Do you need to go into light-mode theme?  Dark text on light
  background is much better than dark mode, so it is strongly
  recommended to do this.
- Can you easily resize your windows for adjusting during teaching?



## Web browser

- Are you doing a lot in a web browser?  Consider making a separate
  profile that is just for demos.
- Install whatever basic safety extensions / ad blockers are most
  relevant, but keep it simple otherwise.
- Can you turn off unneeded menu- and toolbars?
- Does your web browser have a way to reduce its menu bars and other
  decoration size?
  - Firefox-based browsers: go to `about:config` and set
    `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to a value slightly smaller than one,
    like `0.75`.  Be careful you don't set it too small or large since
    it might be hard to recover!  When you set it to something smaller
    than 1, all window decorations become smaller, and you compensate
    by zooming in on the website more (you can set the default zoom to
    be greater than 100% to compensate).  Overall, you get more
    information and less distraction.



## Terminal

### Terminal color schemes

- Dark text on light background, *not* dark theme.  Research and our
  experience says that dark-text-on-light is better in some cases and
  similar in others.
- Make a dedicated "demos" profile in your terminal emulator, if
  relevant.  Or use a different terminal emulator just for demos.
- You might want to make the background light grey, to avoid
  over-saturating people's eyes and provide some contrast to the pure
  white web browser.  (this was an accessibility recommendation when
  looking for ideal color schemes)
- Do you have any yellows or reds in your prompt or program outputs?
  Adjust colors if possible.
- Eliminate menu bars and any other decoration that uses valuable
  screen space.

### Clearing the terminal

- Don't clear terminal often (or ever - un-learn CTRL-L if possible).
  Learner's can follow as fast as you!  More people will wonder what
  just got lost than are helped by seeing a blank screen.  Push
  ``ENTER`` a few times instead to add some white space.


### Terminal size

- Font should be large (a separate history terminal can have a smaller
  font).
- Be prepared to resize the terminal and font as needed.  Know and use
  keyboard shortcuts for changing the font size when you need to show
  more columns (it's also OK if the terminal is wider than your screen
  if most of the right side is not that important to see).  You can
  have a larger font normally, and make it smaller and the terminal
  wider when you have long lines that learners need to see.


### Prompt

Your prompt should be minimal: few distractions, and not take up many
columns of text.

Learners have to read your prompt quickly, understand what you
entered, copy it, all the while not being distracted by everything
else or your screen.  Day 1 git-intro is not the time to have your
fancy git-bash prompt, instead show them how to use git to get that
information.  Set an easily-viewable prompt.

- `prompt-log` (see the next section on command line history) does
  this for you.
- The minimum to do is is `export PS1='\$ '`.
- Blank line between entries: `export PS1='\n\$ '`.
- Have a space after the `$` or `%` or whatever prompt character you
  use.
- Strongly consider the bash shell.  This is what most new people will
  use, and bash will be less confusing to them.  (Later in workshops,
  using other shells and being more adventurous is OK - learners will
  know what is essential to the terminal and what is extra for your
  environment).


### Command line history

You need to find a way to show the recent commands you have entered,
outside of your main window, so that learners can see the recent
commands.

Consider prompt-log by rkdarst
(<https://github.com/rkdarst/prompt-log/>).  It adds a interesting idea
that *the command you enter is also in color* and also provides
terminal history *before the command returns* (see below).

Arrange two terminals, so that there is the main work window and the
history window with a font smaller size - the history can be off to
the side.

See the following screenshot for an ideal arrangement:

```{figure} img/screenshare/s10-kickstart-prompt-log.png
:width: 50%

**S10**: HPC Kickstart course.  Note the colors contrast of the
windows and colors of the prompt and text.  The history is smaller and
doesn't take up primary working space.  The working directory is
in the window titlebar.
```



``````{admonition} Other command line history tools
---
class: dropdown
---

We used to recommend these, and some are still recommended.  But, the
long text is a distraction by now, so it is hidden by default.

Also check the [shell exporter by
sabryr](https://github.com/Sabryr/Teaching-aids), which copies recent
history to a remote server.

**Simple**: The simple way is `PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"` and then
`tail -f -n0 ~/.bash_history`, but this doesn't capture ssh,
subshells, and only shows the command after it is completed.

**Better yet still simple**: Many Software Carpentry instructors use
[this script](https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window),
which sets the prompt, splits the terminal window using tmux and displays command history
in the upper panel. Requirement: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

**Better (bash)**: This prints the output before the command is run,
instead of after.  Tail with `tail -f ~/demos.out`.

```
BASH_LOG=~/demos.out
bash_log_commands () {
    # https://superuser.com/questions/175799
    [ -n "$COMP_LINE" ] && return  # do nothing if completing
    [[ "$PROMPT_COMMAND" =~ "$BASH_COMMAND" ]] && return # don't cause a preexec for $PROMPT_COMMAND
    local this_command=`HISTTIMEFORMAT= history 1 | sed -e "s/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//"`;
    echo "$this_command" >> "$BASH_LOG"
}
trap 'bash_log_commands' DEBUG
```

**Better (zsh)**: This works like above, with zsh.  Tail with `tail -f
~/demos.out`.

```
preexec() { echo $1 >> ~/demos.out }
```

**Better (fish)**: This works like above, but for fish.  Tail with
`tail -f ~/demos.out`.

```
function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> ~/demos.out  ; end
```

**Better (tmuxp)**: This will save some typing. [TmuxP](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/) is a Python program (`pip install tmuxp`) that gives you programmable `tmux` sessions. One configuration that works (in this case for `fish` shell):

```yaml
session_name: demo
windows:
  - window_name: demo
    layout: main-horizontal
    options:
      main-pane-height: 7
    panes:
      - shell_command:
          - touch /tmp/demo.history
          - tail -f /tmp/demo.history
      - shell_command:
          - function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> /tmp/demo.history  ; end
```

**Windows PowerShell**: In [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/),
a split can be made by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+=`. Then, in one of the splits, the following
PowerShell command will start tracking the shell history:
```
Get-Content (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath -Wait
```
Unfortunately, this only shows commands after they have been executed.


```
# used for the fish shell (note: untested)
tail -f -n 0 ~/fish_history | sed -u -e s'/- cmd:/ \>/'

# used for zsh shell (put this into a script file)
clear >$(tty)
tail -n 0 -f ~/.zsh_history | awk -F\; 'NF!=1{printf("\n%s",$NF)}NF==1{printf("n %s ",$1)}'
```
