# Presentation hints - in person

This is in-person specifc extras for the {doc}`presenting` page.

## Before each lesson

- Remember: sticky notes, water, extra whiteboard markers.

- Make your text large enough to be seen in the back, then bigger.
  Make your voice loud enough to be heard in the back, then louder.

- As people are coming in, encourage them to sit next to someone with
  a similar operating system - then, when helping each other, the
  unimportant differences are minimized.

- By the same token, don't allow people to sit alone: ask everyone to
  set next to at least one other person.  That way, people can help
  each other.

- Have a pen and paper next to you.  When you notice problems in the
  material, write it down right away during breaks in the type-along
  parts.

- Set up feedback system (chat, questions, etc)



## Team teaching

- Discuss with co-teachers and helpers about what each of you will do.
  - Hand signals for common situations: too fast/slow in general,
    louder, time for a break, "good enough, move on", "explain more
    here".
- It can be hard for one person to manage everything.  How can
  multiple instructors take part?  Probably the most common ones are:
  - Teach teaching: alternating
    - Commander and navigator: conceptually divide roles of big
      picture teaching and doing the details.
	- If "real" alternating, each section should be 10-15 min at
      least, otherwise too much context switching is distracting.
  - Teach and assist (master helper going around)
  - Teach and observe.
  - Asking directed questions to fill in gaps.
- Tell the students the way the teachers will work together, so that
  it seems coordinated rather than someone is interrupting.



## During the lessons

- Helpers can read [the team leader guide](team-leaders.md).
  Encourage helpers to stand and be
  constantly walking around, people rarely flag helpers from across
  the room.
- Encourage the use of sticky notes (red=need help, green=I am done with the
  solution). They can also be used for voting, e.g. red/green for two
  answers of a multiple choice question.
- Don't touch the learner's keyboard!  This is very hard to do, since
  it's only natural to want to get things done quickly.  The best idea
  we have is to have a pen and sticky notes, when it's hard to spell
  out a command to type, write it instead.
- If appropriate for your topic, create a cumulative
  cheatsheet/diagram on the board as you are presenting.

## Wrap-up
- Use the sticky notes to get good/bad feedback: have people write one
  good and one to be improved thing, and leave the note on the door on
  the way out.
