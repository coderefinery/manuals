# CodeRefinery Zulipchat

The [CodeRefinery zulipchat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) is
where our primary discussion, planning, and action takes place.  Many
things are announced only via Zulipchat.  This is a public chat and
everybody is welcome to join, no invitation needed, and we explicitly
invite anyone to give ideas in any channel or topic.

The chat is a joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage and software), which are other
Nordic projects about scientific computing which share some of the
same people. Together, we have a network of all aspects of modern
scientific computing.

Unlike Slack, zulipchat is very heavily threaded, and one can follow along without being active all the time.  Respond within the
topic (=thread) that is relevant, or make a new topic.  Sometimes you
can find old topics to revive.  


## Channels

Once you join the chat, you will be subscribed to some default
channels.  **The first thing you
should do is join some more channels, depending on your interest.  Join
more channels by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side
on that chat, then selecting what you are interested in.**

The easiest way to find channels of interest is to go through the list and join whichever sounds interesting. You can always leave a channel again too.

If you **mute a channel**, you can see the contents if you click on it,
but you won't get notifications.  If you **mute a topic**, it will be
hidden from view but you can later unmute it in your personal
settings.  Under channel settings, you can request email notifications
for all messages in a certain channel (possibly useful for the announce channels).

Default channels (everyone joining is automatically subscribed):


- #events : Share information about courses, workshops, seminars or other events; can also be used to look for collaborators 
- #jobs : Share open job positions that others here might find interesting too 
- #greetings : New joiners are recommended to introduce themselves here, so we can welcome you. Other greetings/thanks also welcome! 
- #coderefinery : CodeRefinery organization: about the team, project, strategy, CodeRefinery Gitlab 
- #nordic-rse : Nordic Research Software Engineers: members and general discussion about research software.
- #random : Memes, jokes, animal pictures, whatever makes you smile :) 
- #general : Ideas, TIL (today I learned), discussions, tech stuff that do not fit any other channel 
- #help : Community support. Ask questions related to anything about the topics on this chat (CodeRefinery, RSE, scientific software and data, HPC,...) 
- #lessons :  Discussions about CodeRefinery (and other) lessons. There's usually one topic per lesson and other related things. 


There are also multiple sub-communities related to a specific event, group, region: 

- #aalto : Aalto University scientific computing community (+friends)

You are very welcome to create new channels, eg for regional subgroups, such as #finland. 
You can also create topical private channels for groups that significantly
overlap with our community.  Currently, Zulip admins can't add
themselves or others to private channels.

## Good practices and tips

### Views

**Recent conversations**

To follow up on most recent conversations in chat, use `recent conversations`, which shows you all your channels, the number of unread messages per channel, starting with the most recent one.

**Combined feed**

To see all the latest messages in all your channels/topics, use `Combined feed` view.

### Notifications

You can set separate notifications settings for the full chat, channels and topics. 

TODO: show/tell how to change all options

### Topic vs private message

Just want to share something with a small group of people -> Send a private message to multiple people instead of starting a new topic

### Search before creating a new X

Use the search function to search for some relevant keywords before creating a new topic.

### Mark as resolved

TODO: what does this do?


## Chat digest

If this chat is not your main "hang-out spot", but you would still like to stay up to date, you can sign up for the CodeRefinery chat digest, providing one e-mail per week with the latest updates from the chat.

[Sign up for the chat digest e-mail list](https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/subscribe/coderefinery-team).

## Clients

Zulipchat can be used in a web browser, there's a desktop app, mobile
apps, and even a terminal client installable using ``pip``.

## Reacting and voting

We want everyone to take part in chat and express their thoughts, but
of course people don't want to give pointless agreeing replies (but
you can always welcome to do that, too).  So, we encourage everyone to use reactions in cases they want to express agreement/disagreement but not so much they want to send a message.  Common reactions you might see are üëç, üëé (thumbs up/down, agree with general sentiment), üêô (`:octopus:`, awesome/amazing/ace), and well, plenty more that are more obvious.

We also use reactions to express some idea of a more concrete
**vote**, to empower people to take an action (otherwise, it is
difficult to get a decision on anything).  This is not formal or
necessarily binding (so it's not really a vote), but a useful
intermediate system for a young project.  If you see a message
proposing something and you want to say, in no uncertain terms, "I
think you should do that" or not, let us know by the following:

* ‚ÜîÔ∏è (+0, `:left_right:`: I see this and am neutral.
* üîº, üîΩ (+1, -1, `:upvote:`, `:downvote:`) or similar: I
   agree/disagree with this.
* ‚è¨, ‚è´ (+2, -2, `:double_up:`, `:double_down:`): I agree/disagree
   with this and am willing to work on making it happen/finding an
   alternative.

If you want to do something, ask for opinions, and a reasonable time
later it seems the sentiment is positive, consider yourself empowered
to do it.  If you are voting, feel free to be creative with emojis or
numbers, but realize that other reactions may not be so explicit.  Note that if you are negative, you should explain why or alternatives, otherwise your opinion may not be weighted so much.  The person doing the thing decides what to do (and this is open source: we find a way for everyone to do what they need to do).

Do you think you aren't important enough to vote?  That's wrong,
because we are usually interested in the thoughts of everyone.  We
can see who voted and use that to weight our decision if needed.



## Privacy

All activity (except private steams) should be considered public, and
the data controller is zulipchat.com.  Zulip admins can't add
themselves or others to private channels, but still: there is no
contract guaranteeing confidentiality.
