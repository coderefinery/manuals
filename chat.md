# CodeRefinery Zulipchat

The [CodeRefinery zulipchat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) is
where our primary discussion, planning, and action takes place.  Many
things are announced only via zulipchat.  This is a public chat and
everybody is welcome to join, no invitation needed, and we explicitly
invite anyone to give ideas in any thread.

The chat is a joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage and software), which are other
Nordic projects about scientific computing which share some of the
same people.  Together, we have a network of all aspects of modern
scientific computing.

Unlike Slack, zulipchat is very heavily threaded, and it is easy to
follow along without being active all the time.  Respond within the
topic (=thread) that is relevant, or make a new thread.  Sometimes you
can find old threads to revive.  Don't worry, everything is flexible
and you'll quickly learn by watching (and don't worry about going
wrong).


## Streams

Once you join the chat, you will be subscribed to some default
streams (a stream is basically a channel).  **The first thing you
should do is join some more streams, depending on your interest.  Join
more streams by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side
on that chat, then selecting what you are interested in.**

* **#general**: Any topic and random chat (including for the other
