<p>This is a checklist and hints when writing and designing a new lesson.
The master material is in Teaching Tech Together, primarily chapters 6
and 12 for practicalities and 2 and 4 for big picture considerations.
But really, all the book.  See <a class="reference internal" href="../teaching-tech-together/"><span class="std std-doc">the summary we
made</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">the actual
book</a>.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an
effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main points.
Finally, the <a class="reference external" href="https://cdh.carpentries.org/">Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook</a> gives practical information on how to design a new lesson and covers the entire lesson life-cycle with a good overview of the lesson release timeline.</p>
<p>This doesn’t replace your own knowledge in doing the actual teaching
part.  Instead, the first half gives pointers on making sure your
audience can connect to the material, and the last half gives hints
to help you come up with good exercises and examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="backwards-lesson-design">
<h2>Backwards lesson design<a class="headerlink" href="#backwards-lesson-design" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Think test-driven development: decide what you want students to be able
to do, design exercises to measure it, then fill in the gaps with
teaching.  You can see <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/template/">their
summary</a>.  The steps are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Brainstorm what you want to cover.</p></li>
<li><p>Create or reuse learner personas - understand who you want to
teach.  What do they care about?  Perhaps as important is what they
don’t care about: make sure that you don’t go too in depth too
early and turn people off.</p></li>
<li><p>Create some summative assessments, that show what learners should
learn by the end.  Try to connect these to the learner personas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create formative assessments (exercises) that let the learners
practice what you want them to learn.  See below for hints on coming
up with good exercises.  These should also connect to things the
learners will actually do, but can also be more of checkpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Put exercises in a logical order, and fill in any gaps.  Ideally
there should be 15-20 min of teaching between each exercise.  Perhaps
most are short (a few longer examples as needed), to identify a
certain learning goal and misconception.</p></li>
<li><p>Write just enough material to get from one exercise to the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most important point here is to start from learner’s needs and how
they can feel connected, not from the tech details.</p>
<p>When advertising the course, connect it to your learner personas so
that you get the right audience and they know why they should come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics">
<h2>Emotional and intrinsic appeal, other basics<a class="headerlink" href="#emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can think of why people should feel emotionally connected to your
material - maybe it’s too much to expect people to get emotionally
invested, but if you try for that, you’ll end somewhere better.</p>
<p>Try to design around tasks and exercises which your audience will care
about.  For example, don’t say “here are some shell commands”, but
“aren’t you tired of copying all of these files one by one… check
out the shell… once you know it, you will really feel at home.  Here
are some typical things you might do.”.  Intrinsic motivators include
<strong>sense of agency</strong> (being able to do things themselves), <strong>competence</strong>
(usefulness of what they are doing, feeling they know something), and
<strong>relatedness</strong> (doing things that others are doing).</p>
<p>A manual is reference, a tutorial builds a cognitive model.  If you
can build the cognitive model and tell them the “why”, students may be
able to refer to the manuals themselves and become self-sufficient.
Thus, teaching should be more of a
tutorial, with good links to manuals (it can also explicitly teach
how to use the manuals).</p>
<p>Perhaps a related point is inclusiveness: make sure there’s not some
“in” crowd.  Perhaps the best description I have seen: don’t assume
that some people are missing something, but that others have had the
fortune of learning it earlier.  This may not matter in a purely
factual lesson design, but if you are trying to make things
intrinsically or emotionally appealing, it is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-the-audience">
<h2>Who is the audience?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-audience" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Making the <strong>learner personas</strong> are essential to making a good lesson,
even if you think you know who you are teaching to.  This is because
it grounds you into what your audience already knows (or doesn’t know)
and what they are interested in.</p>
<p>You also have different ways people can refer to the material:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a class, with an instructor guiding them</p></li>
<li><p>Reading along by themselves</p></li>
<li><p>In a class, being much more advanced than others, so that they skip
ahead and do advanced material themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planning">
<h2>Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#planning" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do some planning, and <em>document it</em> - the design process helps
others to teach and modify.  At least put it in the README.  (this
is the <strong>designer/maintainer’s guide</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put the main points from the “backwards lesson design process” in
here, enough that it is easier for someone to improve your lesson
than to redo it.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make learner personas: what is your target audience?</p></li>
<li><p>Decide learning objectives based on the personas: high-level end
goals.  What students get out, not what they do.</p></li>
<li><p>Also make a <em>guide</em> for teaching (<strong>instructor’s guide</strong>), “if you
want to present this, do this”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much preparation is needed?  Is it enough to know the topic
and have read the material?</p></li>
<li><p>Things to prepare before the presentation.  Does anything need to
be set up?</p></li>
<li><p>Practical notes on presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there solutions to exercises somewhere?  Are they needed?</p></li>
<li><p>Include some pre-assessment questions which can be asked at the
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps you should do this at the end, but at least starting the
instructor’s guide at the beginning will frame your writing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing">
<h2>Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#writing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is not much here yet, mostly just follow the “backwards lesson design”
above.  The hardest part is coming up with good exercises, so our
practical advice is to mix and match from the two taxonomies at the
bottom and the exercise types.  Try to think of diverse types of
exercises.</p>
<p>Exercise design is the time it is most useful to be with others to do
brainstorming, so we highly recommend discussing with others at this
point.  Because exercises are used to set the overall outline of the
lesson, this also gives people a say in the overall outline - in a
very concrete way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you include the emotional starting point at the beginning - why
should you care and why is this cool?</p></li>
<li><p>This should also be at the start and end of each section: not just what
or how, but why?</p></li>
<li><p>Part of this is also having a <strong>student’s guide</strong>, so that
people independently studying can know how to follow the material.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s OK to have more material than can be presented or than people
should know, but <em>label things well</em>, including <em>labeling the difficulty</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the beginning, what sections are expected to be taught in
short/long versions?  What’s advanced/optional?</p></li>
<li><p>Label advanced and optional sections as such.  Perhaps also really
basic sections that can be skipped for that reason.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan for mixed abilities.  It’s OK to have optional (basic) and
advanced sections, as long as they are clearly labeled.  Mainly, don’t
have people think that you are uncoordinated because you are skipping
advanced sections.</p>
<p>Once you are done, update maintainer’s and instructor’s guides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-and-conclusion">
<h2>Introduction (and conclusion)<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The introduction is the first thing people hear, and needs special
thought.  Don’t start with a cold open, just going straight to the
topic (“what” or “how”).  Instead, have some careful motivation
(“why”).  It could be especially good to talk about what is wrong with
the current state of affairs (give a good, simple example) and why it
should be improved.  Then start talking about what the improvements
are.</p>
<p>Ideally, the introduction should serve as an self-contained abstract
of your material.  If you need to teach your lesson in only 10% of the
time you have, can you use just the introduction to do it?</p>
<p>Conclusion should remind people about why this is cool and discuss
what comes next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thinking-of-exercises">
<h2>Thinking of exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-of-exercises" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example.  It’s mixing
with smaller, more conceptual things to reduce the cognitive load and
be able to have more frequent exercises.</p>
<p>One of your other primary goals should be to make your exercises
<em>relevant</em>.  Abstract will lead to disconnection. Connect the exercises
to the real world.  Also, can you tell a complete story with
exercises?  (Remember, in backwards lesson design, the exercises
form the story of the lesson.)</p>
<p>Remember that not every exercise has to be long.  Try to have
frequent short exercises to get immediate feedback, with some long
ones.</p>
<p>Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson.  Even
if you are preparing the rest of the lesson mostly alone, consider a
good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to cover”
to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers
X”, think of the lists below inspiration.  Not every exercise has to be an
sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use different
types:</p>
<p>Basic types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool - try to
design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific
misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming)</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows
you to get feedback)</p></li>
<li><p>Inverted coding (given code, have to debug)</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order,
learner must only put in proper order)</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tracing execution</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow (e.g. what is the sequence of
values that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> takes on?)</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work)</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of
situation/problem)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More conceptual:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Draw a diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking through the learning taxonomies also helps to come up with
diverse types of exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bloom’s taxonomy: hierarchical skill levels (can you help students
to “grow a level”?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remembering</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Applying</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating</p></li>
<li><p>Creating</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy: complementary types instead of hierarchical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foundational knowledge</p></li>
<li><p>Applications</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Human dimension</p></li>
<li><p>Caring</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to learn</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
