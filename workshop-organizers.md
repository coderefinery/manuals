# Workshop organizers

Everyone can be part of the workshop organizing team. But we are mostly looking for help from the community for team leads, expert helpers and instructors.
If you want to help 'in the background', join the ´#workshops´ stream in the [coderefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) and see what is planned.
There is a lot of roles to fill already before the actual workshop, as well as after:
