# OLD: Co-instructors

Since we focus on {doc}`team-teaching`, almost everyone is a
co-instructor.  But this page is focused on *onboarding new
co-instructors in their first lessons*, so focuses on explaining the
most common starting point.



## Why co-teaching?

Demo of team teaching.  Two people are speaking, in this case one
is typing and giving the small point of view, and one is explaining
the big point of view.
```

The dream of interactive teaching is hard to achieve: most audiences
are very quiet and even if someone does speak up, it is a small
fraction of the audience.  We have found a better way: Build the
interaction straight in to the course by co-teaching.  Instead of
trying to have a conversation with students, we have a conversation
among co-instructors.

Co-teaching provides other benefits, such as easier preparation and
easier presentation.



## How co-teaching works: guide and demo-giver

Main article: {doc}`team-teaching`.

We have developed several ways of team teaching, but for starters we
suggest the "guide and demo-giver" approach.  The **guide** manages
the overall flow through the lesson.  The **demo-giver** does the
typing during the demonstrations.  So, for example:

- The guide introduces a type-along session and walks through the
  steps while...
- ... the demo-giver does the typing in the screenshare
- The guide and demo-giver ask each other about what is happening.

During other times, the demo-giver and guide ask each other questions
when the other is talking.
