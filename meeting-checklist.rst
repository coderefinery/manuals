Meeting checklist
=================

This checklist was made because we had a major issue with *not
announcing good events* to our community because we weren't sure what
to do, thus a community doesn't form.  These steps should be taken to
announce any event unless there is a specific reason not to (for
example, a workshop is well underway and organizers known).  You don't
*have* to follow what you see here, but the point is to make
announcements as boring as possible, so that it gets done quickly and
well-enough.


As soon as meeting topic/time is decided
----------------------------------------

* Decide central HackMD/join link.  (Join link can be decide later by
  putting it in the hackmd).

* Create a calendar event for yourself, and send it to related
  people.  You should be ready to forward this to people who request.
  It's OK if the event only includes HackMD link (+ join link, if
  known).

* [Mailing list: not yet present, we are relying on the other options
  here.]

* Make a post in #announcements.  Don't be shy, just do it.
  ``<time:``\ TAB will produce a time picker that adjusts for
  everyone's timezones.

  ::

     At <time:...>, there will be a [meeting on topic].  Topics will
     include [a few highlights to let people know who should attend].

     HackMD (including connection details): <link>
     More info: #[stream-name]

     If you want a calendar invite, send [me] a private message (or
     react with :email: quickly if I know your email already).

* Make a Twitter post for most meetings, if you want a broader
  community to attend.

  * You can do this yourself via the "tweet-together" Github Action:

    * CodeRefinery:
      https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery-twitter/
    * Nordic-RSE:
      https://github.com/nordic-rse/
    * Research Software Hour: CR + AaltoSciComp

  * You can do it from the web interface, find the "Create new tweet"
    button from the readme.

  * Edit the file path.  It pre-fills ``YYYY/MM`` outside of the text
    box, but you can backspace and change that to current year/month.

  * Suggested template::

      [title] will be held at [time CEST]. [optional: why should
      someone attend?  Attend if...]

      More info via our chat https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals
      [tags]

  * Suggested tags

    * CodeRefinery: ``#coderefinery``
    * Nordic-RSE: ``#rseng``
    * Research software hour: ``#rseng``

  * Someone else should merge immediately after checking facts
    (ideally have merged by the time the meeting ends).  Don't wait
    for "permission" or something like that which may never come.



Days before the meeting
------------------------
* Send reminders to the #announcements streams.  You can find the old
  topic and reply to it, quoting the whole text.



Archive meeting agenda
----------------------
* Archive the agenda, if needed.
