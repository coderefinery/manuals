<p>We’ve designed the workshop so that it is very hard for one person to

role of ensuring a good environment.</p>
<p>If you see anything that is not supporting an positive learning
environment, please let us know.</p>

<p>We teach all the essential tools which are usually skipped in

<p>Most importantly, <strong>you do not have to know everything</strong> (we don’t, either).
If you aren’t sure if you can be a team leader: you probably can be one!</p>
<p>This is what we expect:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used Git some since then, OR have some general experience with Git (branching,
pull requests) and command line work, OR be able to generally follow
the path of the exercises that we have laid out.</p></li>
<li><p>Be present in your teams physical/virtual room at least during exercise sessions of the workshop.</p></li>

<p>The workshop schedule on the main workshop page contains
links to lesson material, including lists of exercises.</p>
<p>The best analogy is <strong>watching a popular sporting event on TV</strong>.
There are periods of lots of activity, and clear periods of breaks where you
do your own thing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone follows stream during lessons</strong> - lessons, demos, exercise
intros, going over solutions, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For questions and instructions we use a collaborative document</strong> (more below).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exercises during the lessons are done individually or in teams</strong> and there is many
ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Watch and work alone</p></li>

<p>We try our best to be very explicit about what is going on.
Your first goal should be to make sure the learners are engaged and no one is left behind.</p>
<p>The instructors should clearly tell which exercises and for how long (we try to
make all exercise sessions at least 20 minutes long).  If anything is unclear
please ask via collaborative document, you are our safety net.</p>
<p><strong>Make it easy for learners to ask for help</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure your group knows your name and that you are their team lead.</p></li>
<li><p>Always start by greeting people and ask how the lesson is going; report back if there is something instructors should be aware of.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage your team to also put answered questions in the collaborative document, someone else might be wondering the same thing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Want extra help?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is OK to not know something!</p></li>
<li><p>Use the collaborative document if there is questions that you cannot answer.
Our instructors and expert helpers are watching it and try to answer every question.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major problems?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Exercise time is limited, watch the time and keep things moving.</p></li>
<li><p>If some debugging takes to long, it’s reasonable to describe the problem in the
collaborative document. An expert helper may have seen the problem
before.</p></li>
<li><p>If any one problem takes too long, it’s OK to say “we don’t have
time, let’s come back”</p></li>

<p>As a team leader, we do not expect you to know all our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/lessons/core/">CodeRefinery training material</a>, but if you have time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Take a look at the exercises in advance</strong> of each day (the exercise
plan is on the workshop page.  Lessons have an “exercise list” page that
shows everything), check that you understand the general point of each of
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Often we only manage to adjust exercises and lessons shortly before the
workshop. Thank you for your understanding and patience.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are interested, also read through the <strong>instructor guides</strong> for the lessons (there is a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).</p></li>
<li><p>Use GitHub issues on the lesson GitHub pages to point out issues with exercises and the materials.</p></li>

<p>As a team leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You are between the learners and the organizers and instructors, please use the collaborative document to communicate.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your team will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You are our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either). It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>If you meet virtually: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first exercise session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your team, be present and encourage learners to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
won’t.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>

<h2>What we want to avoid<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-want-to-avoid" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Take over the learner’s keyboard</strong> (neither physically nor remotely).
Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the collaborative document and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Criticize certain programs</strong>, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool</strong>. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into <strong>complex or detailed technical discussion</strong> with the one or two people
in the audience/team who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretend to know more than you do</strong>. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use “just”, “easy”, “simply”, or other demotivating words</strong>. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feign surprise</strong> at learners not knowing something.
“You’ve really never heard of (sometool)?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="strategies-for-leading-a-team">
<h2>Strategies for leading a team<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies-for-leading-a-team" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your team, no matter if you meet in a physical or virtual room (Physical room would need a larger screen for every one to see though):</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone does the exercises themselves until someone has a question</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Encourage learners to ask multiple times; if necessary share your/learners screen and discuss.</p></li>
<li><p>If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that the barrier for disturbing the silence is too big.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>To start things off, team leader can share the screen.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do not try to hide mistakes (they make good learning opportunities, “can you spot my mistake?”) and discuss your solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
if no one volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Team leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You don’t actually <em>have</em> to do the exercises</strong>.  You could apply
lesson material to your own team’s work, review what was just said,
have a free-form discussion, etc. - if those are more valuable.  You
can always come back to exercises later, or let learners do them as homework.</p>

<h2>How to solve common problems in teams?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-solve-common-problems-in-teams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>One learner asks very many questions</strong>, ends up monopolizing all of
the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
may not get the exercises done</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Encourage them to ask in the collaborative document</p></li>
<li><p>It can be very hard to say “no”, but it’s more important to have
balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
to say no, you can try things such as “I’m sorry, but in order
to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
later - would you like to watch?”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a <strong>lot of time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on it for a minute or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage to describe the problem in the collaborative document. Our expert helpers may be able to help.
Nothing wrong with this, because there is no deadline or time limit.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>No one asks any questions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure people know that you are there for them if they need help</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some exercises are easier than others and people really may not need any help with some of them</p></li>
<li><p>Remind that the recording can also be watched later, if people cannot keep up</p></li>

<div class="section" id="more-background-about-scaling-workshops">
<h2>More background about scaling workshops<a class="headerlink" href="#more-background-about-scaling-workshops" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, a workshop has instructors and team leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>team leaders</em> . A team leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
<p>Team leaders are an essential part of the CodeRefinery workshop team and
allow CodeRefinery to scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.
Team leaders will guide their team through the course, keep
time, and let us know when more help/time is needed during the exercise sessions.
Instructors and expert helpers are always available via the collaborative document. It is very
likely that you’ll grow as a mentor and learn how to be a more efficient
teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-background-about-teams">
<h2>More background about teams<a class="headerlink" href="#more-background-about-teams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A team could be for example a
group of colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge
on the tools presented in the workshop. This person can act as team leader
for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way
you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and
discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers.</p>
<p>Sometimes we also allow learners to register as individual learner with
interest in being in a team. We then try to arrange those people in teams which
stay together for all exercise sessions on all days and provide a zoom breakout
room with a team/exercise leader. Since this is dependent on our team leader
capacities, we cannot accept infinite amount of learners.
Being assigned a team as a learner allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same team
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>
