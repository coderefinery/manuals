# Tips for helpers

## Preparing to help

As a helper, we do not expect you to know all our [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) but if you have time:

- Read through the Instructor Guide for the Lessons (ask instructors if you do not know where to find them)
- Be ready to introduce yourself in one or two sentences: think about what you would like to convey as helpers to the classroom. 

## Tips for helping during the workshop

### Code of Conduct

Teaching isn't about helping those who are already "in", it is for those who aren't.  Thus, we follow [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) for all our interactions before, during and after workshops.

If you see anything that is not supporting an equal learning environment, please mention it to one of instructors.

### Creating a positive learning environment

As a helper, you have a crucial role during workshops:

- Encourage learners to learn from each other. 
- Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that they will learn more working together. 
- Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors. Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for instructors. 
- As we said, you don't have to know everything, just like learners don't necessarily know everything.  Try to frame this together.

### Things you should not do in a workshop


- Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain them.
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be at the workshop.
- Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help.
- Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.
- Feign surprise. Saying things like “I can't believe you don't know X” or “You've never heard of Y?” signals to the learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them from asking questions in the future.

### During the workshop, practically.

- Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are convenient, students will ask.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room.
- Take over the learner's keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it implies you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try to have a sticky note pad and pen, write the commands that they should type (we have this material)
