# Collaborative document mechanics and controls

[Hackmd](https://hackmd.io) or  [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) are real-time text editors online.  We use it to:
* As a threaded chat, to **answer questions and provide other information** without
  interrupting the main flow of the room.
* provide everyone with a **more equal opportunity to ask questions**.
* **create notes** which will be archived, for your later reference.

You do not need to login/create an account to be able to edit the document.

## Basic controls

```{figure} img/hackmd--controls.png

This may look slightly different on mobile devices and small windows.
```

- At the top (left or right), you can switch between **view**,
  **edit**, and **split view and edit** modes.

- You write in [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) here.  Don't
  worry about the syntax, just see what others do and try to be like
  that!  Someone will come and fix any problems there may be.

- Please go back to view mode if you think you won't edit for a
  while - it will still live update.


## Asking questions

**Always ask questions and add new sections at the very bottom**.
You can also answer and comment on older questions, too.

Questions and answers in bullet points
```

Since we plan to publish the questions and answers later as part
of the workshop page, we recommend to not use any names. You can indicate
your own name to make it easier to discuss more during the workshop, but
then always use this form: `[name=Myname]`. This makes it easier for
us to automatically remove all names before publishing the notes.

Other hints:

- Use `+1` to agree with a statement or question (we are more likely
  to comment on it).

- Please leave some blank lines at the bottom

- NOTE: Please don't "select all", it highlights for everyone and adds a
  risk of losing data (there are periodic backups, but not instant).

- It can be quite demanding to follow the collaborative document closely.  Keep an eye
  on it, but consider how distracted you may get from the course.  For
  things beyond the scope of the course, we may come back and answer
  later.


## Don't get overwhelmed

There can be a flood of information on the collaborative document.  Scan for what is
important, then if you would like come back later.  But it is
important to keep checking it.


## Privacy

- Assume the collaborative document is **public and published: you never
  need to put your name there**.

- The collaborative document will be **published on the website afterwards**.  We will
  remove all non-instructors' names, but it's easier if you don't add
  it there in the first place.

- Please keep the link private during the workshop, since
  security is "editable by those who have the link".

- You can use `[name=YOURNAME]`, to name yourself.  We *will* remove
  all names (but not the comments) before archiving the notes (use
  this format to make it easy for us).
